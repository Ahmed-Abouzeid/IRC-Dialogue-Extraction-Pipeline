read scrollback

dcook
Teenage dcook would not have been fond of tying a tie during high school


00:26

dcook
Although I think I liked the idea of a uniform just so that I didn't have to pick out clothes to wear when I did drag myself into the classroom..


00:26

* dcook
probably would've preferred something from a sci fi movie rather than a suit and tie though


00:32

jcamins
dcook: you would've been brilliant young Wesley Crusher?


00:37

dcook
It's been a long time since I watched TNG, but I think I disliked Wesley Crusher :p


00:38

dcook
I think I was pro-borg and yet anti-conformity


00:38

dcook
Quite the paradox


00:38

dcook
Maybe I just liked the borg aesthetic and order :p


00:39

jcamins
Everyone disliked brilliant young Wesley Crusher.


00:40

dcook
hehe


00:40

dcook
I think I disliked how chipper he seemed


00:40

dcook
I was a bit more of a moody teenager


00:40

dcook
Wesley Crusher seemed eager to please, and that was the opposite of what I wanted to do

wizzycrayfish

02:09

dcook
lol


02:09

dcook
Nah, I think this is still low level nerd


02:09

dcook
If we were arguing specific details from particular episodes... that would be full nerd


02:10

dcook
Or debating Captain Kirk vs Captain Picard


02:10

wizzycrayfish
as if there is a debate to be had there.


02:10

wizzycrayfish
because we all know picard is better. :P


02:10

dcook
hehe


02:11

dcook
I'm still only midway through TOS at the moment


02:11

dcook
Been sidetracked by Outlander


02:11

dcook
And now organizing old photos on my desktop via an app on my phone as I hold a sleeping baby all evening


02:12

wizzycrayfish

02:12

02:15

wahanui
bonjour, wizzycrayfish


04:50

magnuse
wizzycrayfish!


04:50

wahanui

04:50

wizzycrayfish
magnuse \o/


04:50

magnuse
crayfish?


04:51

wizzycrayfish
blame eythian


04:51

wizzycrayfish
(also I'm on a different computer and I can't be bothered to set up my bouncer lol)


04:51

dcook
hehe


04:51

dcook
Isn't magnuse up super early?


04:51

dcook
Also...


04:51

wizzycrayfish
yeah I was just thinking that


04:51

dcook
"Some of the most significant recent developments in Canadian currency were the withdrawal of the $1, $2, and $1,000 notes in 1987, 1996, and 2000 respectively. The $1 and $2 denominations have been replaced with coins, colloquially referred to as the "loonie" and "toonie" respectively. In 2000, the $1,000 note was removed at the request of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as it was reported that they were largely


04:51

dcook
being used for money laundering and organized crime."


04:52

dcook
Fun fact ^


04:52

wizzycrayfish
hehe loonie and toonie


04:52

dcook
Back at my parents' house, I actually still have a few old Canadian $1 bills


04:52

wizzycrayfish
i loooove $1 and $2 coins


04:52

dcook
One of my favourite things about Australia? They call them "one dollar coin" and "two dollar coin"


04:52

dcook
Loonie and toonie...


04:52

wizzycrayfish
though oz's ones are so bewildering


04:52

dcook
wizzycrayfish: They're the royals of coins!


04:52

dcook
Yeah?


04:52

wizzycrayfish
why are the 2's smaller than the 1s?


04:52

* magnuse
is up at the regular time, but noone else is up yet, so i might as well try and work a little


04:53

wizzycrayfish
MAKES NO SENSE


04:53

dcook
Because good things come in small packages?


04:53

wizzycrayfish
pft


04:53

dcook
hehe


04:53

dcook
I like that they're smaller


04:53

wizzycrayfish
nz does it properly.


04:53

dcook
I can have a pocketful of $2 coins and have it add up without weighing me down


04:53

dcook
Yeah?


04:53

dcook
How big is your 50 cent piece?


04:53

magnuse
our coins have all the wrong sizes


04:53

wizzycrayfish
appropriately sized in order :P


04:53

dcook
magnuse: How long have you been awake?


04:54

magnuse
23 minutes


04:54

dcook
wizzycrayfish: Ok, that does sound amazing


04:54

magnuse
24


04:54

dcook
magnuse: Ok, that doesn't seem so bad. You have kids so I'll allow it


04:54

* dcook
went to bed at 3am and woke up at 8am?


04:54

magnuse
thanks


04:54

dcook
np


04:54

magnuse
ouch!


04:54

dcook
^_^


04:54

magnuse
:-)


04:54

wizzycrayfish
5 is alright tho


04:54

wizzycrayfish
that's enough to get some dreams in


04:54

dcook
Yeah, it's a good night of sleep


04:54

* magnuse
needs 8 hours


04:54

dcook
I don't know why people even get more than 5


04:54

dcook
Yeah?


04:54

* dcook
hasn't gotten 8 hours in...


04:55

dcook
I used to be a 9 hour person myself


04:55

wizzycrayfish
I'm ok with 6-7


04:55

magnuse
with less than 8 i'm a wreck


04:55

dcook
Or.. or... 2 hours. I had some good times in uni on 2 hours of sleep


04:55

magnuse
hehe


04:55

wizzycrayfish
now get down in to the 2-3-4's and I'm a right wreck


04:55

magnuse
i'm getting old


04:55

dcook
It is handy being in one's twenties when having a baby... no doubt about that


04:56

wizzycrayfish
<withering stare>


04:56

dcook
I see a lot of wealthy people pushing around prams


04:56

dcook
wizzycrayfish: You know, that's the first thing you ever wrote to me on IRC :p


04:56

wizzycrayfish
what?


04:56

dcook
Back in 2012


04:56

dcook
<withering stare>


04:56

wizzycrayfish
hehe no way


04:56

dcook
Well, worded slightly differently


04:56

dcook
haha yep


04:56

wizzycrayfish
seriously?


04:56

magnuse
lulz


04:56

wizzycrayfish
that can't be tru


04:56

dcook
I think I said something rather stupid, and you gave me a withering one


04:56

dcook
hehe


04:57

dcook
Me and jcamins were having a bit of a heated back and forth


04:57

wizzycrayfish
I'm not sure I've said that to anyone else!


04:57

dcook
I could probably find it in the archives..


04:57

wizzycrayfish
lol maybe


04:57

dcook
Funny how time changes things


04:58

dcook
#koha has been so good for me


04:58

dcook
H'okay... 2013 ... probably march..


04:58

dcook
2012 i mean


04:59

dcook
Hmm maybe it wasn't withering..


05:00

http://irc.koha-community.org/[…]3-02-05#i_1176687


05:00

wizzycrayfish
loool


05:00

dcook
lol


05:01

dcook
I wonder why that was 2013...


05:01

dcook
So it couldn't have been one of the first things you ever said to me


05:01

wizzycrayfish
clearly it was memorable :P


05:01

dcook
lol


05:01

dcook
Just a little bit!

dcook
It's weird...I'm not finding my earlier stuff


05:02

dcook
Google seems to think this is my earliest mention http://irc.koha-community.org/koha/2012-03-16


05:03

dcook
But surely I was on IRC before I sent in that patch..


05:04

magnuse
the irc log search has 2012-06-27 as the first date


05:04

http://irc.koha-community.org/[…]oha;q=;offset=750


05:04

dcook
Yeah I was just about to post that


05:04

dcook
Lost my connection for a sec though :p


05:04

dcook
Bizarre


05:05

magnuse
i disconnected you so i could say it first


05:05

dcook
lol


05:05

dcook
Tricksy!


05:05

magnuse
did you change your nick?


05:05

dcook
And after I permitted you to get up at that time...


05:05

dcook
Maybe?


05:05

wahanui
Maybe is a momentaneous error


05:05

dcook
I would doubt it... but maybe

ponders


05:05

dcook
That must be it


05:05

dcook
Mmmm


05:05

dcook
Originally... I did use a web client


05:05

dcook
So maybe I did use whatever nickname was autogenerated


05:06

dcook
As I didn't think I was really going to be sticking around :p


05:06

magnuse
"05:50 dcook I installed 3.8.0 back in May" :-)


05:06

dcook
This is really shaking my memory confidence... haha


05:06

dcook
I started in January that year..


05:06

dcook
But I suppose I didn't start really working on Koha until later


05:07

dcook
"05:52caitcustomizations are always trouble"


05:07

dcook
^


05:07

dcook
That's the thing I remember most... haha


05:08

magnuse
and your whole job was dealing with customizations?


05:08

dcook
At that stage for sure


05:08

dcook
We were on 3.2 and so behind the times


05:08

dcook
Of course, we still have way too many local customizations...


05:09

dcook
And now I'm busy with non-Koha work so I can't upstream stuff..


05:09

* dcook
shouldn't even be here right now


05:09

magnuse
bbl


05:09

dcook
laters magnuse


05:09

dcook
I must have come in with a different nick earlier... as I don't see jcamins getting short with me :p


05:10

dcook
Ugh, I need to stop reading this. I can never stand records of me fromt he past :p


05:10

dcook
wizzycrayfish: But yes. Withering look... stayed in my memory :p

mveron: did you notice that you have to enter amounts with a comma now when adding a fine/fee manually?


07:54

it seems to be related to the new entry thing - and it's only in that one place

hi, I try to reset my database, so I recreate it then when I do a updatedatabase.pl I have the following error : DBIx::Class::Row::get_column(): No such column 'serialseq_x' on Koha::Schema::Result::Serial at installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl line 11518. I don't know what to do, any idea ?


09:21

eythian
how did you reset it?

Francesca joined #koha


09:23

morgane
eythian: I droped and created it then I put a demo dump. and I just solved my problem :) thanks


09:24

eythian
cool :) I'd have guessed that the demo was from a different version and the update didn't kick in for some reason.


09:30

morgane
yes the demo was from an older version, but I run several times the updatedatabase.pl and now it seems to work.
