morning


13:44

owen
Hi oceb


13:49

oceb
hi owen


13:51

oceb
do you know why advanced search with Date of publication, distribution (260c) isn't workin on opac?


13:51


schuster joined #koha


13:51

owen
oceb: Does it return no results, or incorrect results?


13:51

oceb
never return results =/


13:52

owen
oceb: What version of Koha?


13:52

oceb
3.0.5


13:57

owen
Are you referring to the "publication date range" option?


13:58

oceb
exactly! :D


13:59

oceb
when i put a date p.e. "1998" or "-2009" or "1997-" it doesn't return results


13:59

oceb
but without a date, it returns...


13:59

owen
I assume other searches are working okay?


13:59

oceb
yeah


14:00

owen
Maybe someone else here can verify: Does the publication date search work by looking at 008?


14:01

oceb
uhmmm


14:01

oceb
how i can do a date search on 008 ?


14:02

owen
oceb: I thought the publication date range search *did* search on the date in 008, but I'm hoping someone else here can tell me if that's correct


14:03

oceb
=O


14:04

oceb
I thought that search was on the field 260c


14:06

owen
260c can contain non-numeric data, so you can't ask a computer to do numeric comparisons on it without attempting to sanitize it.


14:06

owen
I thought the pub date search worked with 008 because of that.


14:08

schuster
I can't verify but from my experience with Bib dates so far depending I suspect it is coming from the biblio.copyrightdate or biblioitems, but I'm not sure


14:08

oceb
=o


14:08

oceb
omg


14:08

schuster
where that is being derived from and scrubbed to a single number.  I have not compared that, but will take a look.


14:09

oceb
i think 99% of my books doesn't have a date in 008 >.<


14:09

oceb
i'll test one, im putting a date on a book and now im reindexing


14:19

oceb
omg


14:19

oceb
it works!


14:19

oceb
thanks owen :)


14:20

oceb
now i need to put all dates from 260c to 008 =(


14:22

owen
oceb: sounds like a job for a Perl guru


14:24

* owen
thinks we had to do the same thing at one point, but it wasn't me that did it


14:24

schuster
so it is pulling the date from the 008 - do you know is that how it got the information for the biblio.copyrightdate as well?


14:26

* chris_n
heads off to fix a naughty win32 box


14:26

schuster
shame on that box... ;)


14:27

schuster
Owen - I want to thank you again for your help last week..  I'm really excited about the possibilities, now I just have to do something with it!


14:27

owen
Sure thing schuster, I know you'd asked me about it before and I'm glad you pestered me about it


14:27

Ropuch
Hm, I need to fix 008 with dates from 260c too


14:28

Ropuch
This means some perl exercisies ;>


14:32

jwagner
owen, you're talking about the 008 positions 7-10 for the pubyear, correct?


14:32

owen
Yes


14:32

jwagner
Thanks.  I have a site that's getting data converted by Marcive right now -- a timely reminder to send them to make sure that's getting filled in.


14:38

oceb
wow


14:38

oceb
not everithing is perl :)


14:39

oceb
here in my library we have some code written in php to modifiy both marc and marcxml


14:40

oceb
but I am learning Perl little by little with koha :D


14:49

hdl_laptop
oceb: :'(


14:49


chris_n2 left #koha


14:49

hdl_laptop
learning PERL with koha is a hard school


14:50

schuster
MarcEdit again might be able to help in that job...  I know I've used it's find x and place it in y feature several times.  Don't know how it would work on a leader/008 field.


14:51

chris_n
bye chris_n2


14:51

hdl_laptop
schuster++


14:51

schuster
Question to the list - has anyone else seen this?  http://bagno.be/localcovers.html  - would it still work?


14:52

oceb
hdl_laptop : yeah.... when i come here, i have no idea of what is perl :S


14:54

oceb
perl is... powerfull but... some complicated to beginners :D Php is friendly with beginners :) Anyway im happy with koha and my newbie-knowledge of perl


14:56

schuster
interesting regarding the 008 - biblios.copyrightdate comes from the 260c though in the database NOT the 008.


14:56


chris_n left #koha


14:56

schuster
I just ran a test.


14:57


chris_n joined #koha


15:06

schuster
chris - just went through the git presentation - it is powerful - glad you understand it!!!


15:07

owen
That's what I like about git: I can get stuff done with it, and people smarter than me can do magic with it.


15:07

schuster
magic - kinda like owen the wizard with css ;)


15:08

schuster
I just did some further testing and biblios.copyrightdate - scrubs everything except the first set of numbers. ie 2010, [p2009] in copyrightdate shows 2010, with [p2009], 2010 shows 2009...


15:10

schuster
When searching what is displayed on the bib screen is the copyrightdate field so in the example above 2010, then 2009 not the full MARC representation.


15:22


sekjal joined #koha


15:36

schuster
ok new question for the techies.  I may also post it to the koha-devel list for responses.  I have 53,000 pictures of students on a remote server.


15:37

schuster
I tried to scp them in, but guess what there are limitations, so I'm thinking of setting up a cron job to setup the fileshare on the windows box, and then issue a set of scp commands once a week in the middle of the night to copy them over.


15:37

schuster
then at the end of the cron would be the script I have to mass add them.


15:38

schuster
Thoughts suggestions?  I'm a librarian here remember that when you respond. thanks....


15:49

wizzyrea
hm, why do you have to add all 53k of them every week?


15:52


brendan joined #koha


15:54

wizzyrea
schuster: maybe I'm not understanding your need, you have 53k photos and you can only move X with scp, so you're thinking of moving batches of them? Or you have 53k photos that you need to add every week


15:54

wizzyrea
or... something else


15:55

owen
wizzyrea: Looks like he put more details into a message to koha-devel


15:56

schuster
There are files put on a share for several departments to use of pictures of all the kids.  I never know when they get put there, and the dates on the files are the dates they are taken by the photographer


15:56

schuster
hence the reason for loading ALL of them.


15:57

schuster
If there are problems with pictures the librarian lets me know and I inform the powers that be to adjust the photo names etc... to make them match correctly.  We use the photos with the grade book program, and lunchline.


15:57

wizzyrea
Ah, sorry I didn't look at my list mail


15:58

schuster
sorry I was somewhat brief here in my description.


16:00

wizzyrea
it's too bad it's a windows server, you could rsync


16:03

chris_n
you can still rsync


16:03

chris_n
http://www.aboutmyip.com/About[…]App/DeltaCopy.jsp


16:03

wizzyrea
I didn't realize there was a windows version ^.^


16:04

wizzyrea
oh sweet, had no idea, thanks chris


16:04

wizzyrea
chris_n


16:04

chris_n
I use it to sync my main webradio broadcast server with the warm-standby box


16:05

chris_n
schuster: you can do a share if you use samba


16:05

wizzyrea
are you the king of shoehorning windows in to unix shoes?


16:05

chris_n
but rsync is probably the thing here


16:05

chris_n
wizzyrea: I like to see windows in a vbox frame inside of my gnome interface


16:05

wizzyrea
LOL


16:06

wizzyrea
I frankly can't stand to look at it anymore >.>


16:07

chris_n
schuster: you can setup rsync on your koha box and deltacopy on your win32 box and away you go


16:07

wizzyrea
that has other benefits too, right? Like, he might not have to do all 53k?


16:07

chris_n
rsync will only pickup on the file changes as well (if you like) which will reduce the load on the network after the initial replication


16:08

wizzyrea
yes, that's what I was thinking of


16:08

chris_n
great minds think alike they say ;-)


16:08

chris_n
or at least get stuck in the same rut


16:08

wizzyrea
haha


16:13

schuster
Thanks chris_n AGAIN!  I'll look into this...  I don't have control of the windows box only access to pull/copy from so will have to play with it.

shamelessly encourages a prospective Koha user to maintain their own installation of Koha


16:20

but feel free to maintain your own as well :-)


16:21

mgcleveland_
haha, I'm trying!


16:22

mgcleveland_
but there's just so much perl spaghetti code!


16:22

owen
mgcleveland_: What version of Koha? Does your browser display any javascript errors?


16:22

wizzyrea_
mg do you have access to your koha error log?


16:22


wizzyrea_ is now known as wizzyrea


16:22

mgcleveland_
yes I have access to the logs and there is no error


16:22


Kivutar left #koha

16:23

wizzyrea
what browser are you using?


16:23

mgcleveland_
firefox


16:23

mgcleveland_
here's the weird thing


16:23

mgcleveland_
I have other instances on different servers, and this page works on them


16:23

mgcleveland_
i've diffed the files and there is no difference in the files!


16:23

mgcleveland_
I assume there must be something wrong with  my config or database, but I jsut don't know where to start looking


16:25

schuster
Permissions on the file?


16:25

mgcleveland_
i have root on everything


16:25

mgcleveland_
oh, sorry


16:25

mgcleveland_
good cal


16:25

mgcleveland_
l


16:25

mgcleveland_
let me check


16:25

mgcleveland_
only needs 755, right?


16:27

wizzyrea
it's just blank?


16:27

wizzyrea
apache errors?


16:27

mgcleveland_
I checked the apache logs, as well, but I'll do a re-check


16:28

mgcleveland_
(koha error log is blank)


16:29

mgcleveland_
apache log has no errors pertaining to my session


16:29

wizzyrea
it's got to be something obvious


16:29

mgcleveland_
that's what I'm thinking


16:29

mgcleveland_
but I can't put my finger on it


16:30

mgcleveland_
like I said, I suspect some config or DB issue


16:30

wizzyrea
do you have itypes defined?


16:30

wizzyrea
have you been through the system preferences to set up a library?


16:30

wizzyrea
2nd being more important probably


16:30

mgcleveland_
let me see


16:31

wizzyrea
(if you don't have a library, I don't think it will let you add bibs(


16:31

wizzyrea
(it definitely won't let you add patrons)


16:31

mgcleveland_
(i'm a CS/programmer guy, so when it comes to the library aspects of the system I'm a little lost, but I'll try to hang :) )


16:31

wizzyrea
we get that a lot :)


16:31

mgcleveland_
haha


16:31

mgcleveland_
so how can I see if a library exists?


16:32

wizzyrea
more -> administration -> libraries and groups


16:32

mgcleveland_
oh yes


16:32

wizzyrea
should list them


16:32

mgcleveland_
we have 7 branches listed


16:32

wizzyrea
okies, not that...


16:32

mgcleveland_
with no categories set, is this important?


16:33

wizzyrea
I'm taking it that you installed with the default data?


16:33

wizzyrea
so you should have default categories and itypes


16:33

mgcleveland_
yes I did, but we've added data since then


16:33

mgcleveland_
I really apologize but I have a meeting in 15


16:33

wizzyrea
Ah ok


16:33

wizzyrea
np np


16:33

mgcleveland_
thank you so much for your help


16:33

wizzyrea
we're ez


16:33

register trademarks??????


18:27

chris
wizzyrea_: you might need to have a chat with your boss, i fear in order to move things along he is gonna start another set of worries


18:27

wizzyrea_
erm... I think that was a list of things that a foundation could (but KUDOS won't, necessarily)


18:27

wizzyrea_
do


18:28

wizzyrea_
don't read too much into it


18:28

wizzyrea_
he's in agreement


18:28

wizzyrea_
more along the lines of "get a move on and get it done"


18:29

chris
ppl need to be more careful with words is all im saying


18:29

wizzyrea_
KUDOS doesn't have any interest that I know of to register any trademarks regarding koha


18:30

sekjal
we have never mentioned trademarks at all in any of the discussions I've been in on


18:30

wizzyrea_
he's an administrator, he is simply referring to the things a foundation *can* do


18:30

wizzyrea_
and in order to do them, you must have the foundation


18:30

chris
cool, now anyone who reads the irc logs knows that, but anyone who reads the mailing list could be confused into thinking KUDOS is the foundation


18:31

sekjal
that's easy enough to fix... one sec


18:31

chris
thanks sekjal


18:31

its always easier to stop arguments before they start :)

19:07

http://screencast.com/t/M2RlNTY0


19:36

jwagner
That just made my afternoon!


19:37

wizzyrea_
the items display is what I'm referring to


19:37

wizzyrea_
on bibs that have lots of items, the results list is very... icky


19:37

owen
To say the least


19:37

wizzyrea_
or maybe that's fixed in more recent versions


19:37

owen
Not that I know of


19:37

jwagner
I'm not owen, but I think it would be better if the items list was just another line after the bib display instead of in a separate column.  That would give it a much wider table cell to run across.


19:38

chris_n
@quote add jwagner thinks true joy is not wanting to do a telecon, and finding out the other person has forgotten about it & left for the day :-)


19:38

19:38

wizzyrea_
well, it shows several things that it may not need to


19:38

jwagner
chris_n, you had to do that, didn't you :-(


19:38

wizzyrea_
why does it show the call number for checked out items, for example


19:38

wizzyrea_
it's out, you're not going to find it


19:39

owen
...not that that buys you much space


19:39


richard joined #koha


19:39

richard
hi


19:40

wizzyrea_
true, but what if you 1. used the library short name instead of full name, 2. removed the call number 3. changed date due: to Due only for on loan items


19:40

jwagner
wizzyrea, this is staff side, correct?  Is there any value to even showing the call numbers at this stage?  Maybe just a Library A (7 copies), Library B (2 copies) etc.


19:41

wizzyrea_
well I was wondering about that too


19:41

wizzyrea_
I think that for AVAILABLE items it doesn't hurt to show a lot of info


19:41

wizzyrea_
but for checked out or lost items... just as well to go to the bib detail


19:41

wizzyrea_
to find out the dilly


19:41

wizzyrea_
yes, thsi is the staff side


19:42

wizzyrea_
oh and you've got shelving location in there too


19:42

wizzyrea_
so axe that


19:42

wizzyrea_
so, as an example


19:42

wizzyrea_
on loan: Baldwin, Due 01/28/2010


19:43

wizzyrea_
Basehor, Due XXX


19:43

wizzyrea_
etc


19:43

wizzyrea_
1-2 lines instead of 6


19:44

wizzyrea_
i'm more just curious if anyone else has an opinion on how it can be made better


19:44

wizzyrea_
I know it's not a priority


19:44

i'm willing to try to fix it myself, but don't want to do anything that would make people upset

there are more people around now, you might go over your issue


19:46

wizzyrea
again


19:46

wizzyrea
for their benefit


19:46

wizzyrea
but yes, I remember :)


19:46

mgcleveland_
will do


19:47

mgcleveland_
In a nutshell, my addbiblio.pl page is not working


19:47

mgcleveland_
it works on other instances of Koha I have and the files, when diffed, are identical


19:47

mgcleveland_
this leads me to believe it's a config or DB problem

sooooooooo


19:52

mgcleveland_
any ideas?


19:52

wizzyrea
we know that you have libraries, and you're sure you have item types


19:52

mgcleveland_
right, we've got branches


19:53

mgcleveland_
as for the item types, let me check


19:57

mgcleveland_
well as I said, I'm a computer person


19:57

mgcleveland_
hence the lag on figuring out the library stuff


19:59

mgcleveland_
wizzyrea, could I find that by exploring the mysql DB?


20:00

wizzyrea
more -> administration -> Item Types


20:00

mgcleveland_
I == idiot


20:00

wizzyrea
mine looks like this, for example


20:00

wizzyrea
http://screencast.com/t/ZWE1YmVkN


20:00

mgcleveland_
yep, we've got 3


20:01

wizzyrea
okies


20:01

mgcleveland_
so we've got branches and item types


20:01

wizzyrea
and you've got nothing in your koha error log and nothing in your apache log, and addbiblio.pl won't come up


20:01

mgcleveland_
correct


20:01

mgcleveland_
you want to see a screenshot of addbiblio?


20:02

wizzyrea
how are you getting to it, more -> cataloging -> new record?


20:02

mgcleveland_
I click on the "Add MARC" link


20:02

mgcleveland_
it's under "Cataloging"


20:03

wizzyrea
ok, if you do more -> cataloging -> new record what happens?


20:03

wizzyrea
this is what mine looks like: http://screencast.com/t/ODVlMzg1Z


20:03

mgcleveland_
same thing happens


20:03

mgcleveland_
also, I think we may be using different versions of Koha


20:04

mgcleveland_
let me see what mine is right quick


20:04

wizzyrea
seems likely, in which case I probably can't help you


20:04

wizzyrea
if you do more -> about koha what does it say in koha version


20:06

wizzyrea
I'm wondering if you don't have frameworks (though this may not be germane if you are not using 3.0 at least)


20:06

wizzyrea
http://screencast.com/t/ODVlMzg1Z


20:06

wizzyrea
because when you click the button, you should see frameworks


20:06

mgcleveland_
I have frameworks (I'm pretty sure)


20:07

mgcleveland_
when I go to biblio framework, I have default populated


20:07

wizzyrea
I"m curious, can you add members/patrons?

20:10

wizzyrea
then it's not something to do with javascript, probably


20:10

20:10

mgcleveland_
no browser complaints, anyway


20:11

wizzyrea
what version were you running?


20:11

mgcleveland_
well I can't figure that damn thing out!


20:11

mgcleveland_
I think it's 2.2.9


20:11

yea, I can't help you sorry lol I only know 3


20:11

this is driving me crazy!


20:12

mgcleveland_
Not sure why we're on the older version


20:12

mgcleveland_
also, we're serving ours in Persian


20:14

wizzyrea
but I've never run it seriously


20:14

mgcleveland_
and there is no translation for 3.0


20:14

mgcleveland_
(i think)


20:14

wizzyrea
Ahh, well that would do it too


20:14

mgcleveland_
yeah


20:14

mgcleveland_
balls again!


20:15

mgcleveland_
so is 2.2.9 not supported any more?


20:15

wizzyrea
you could always get someone to do a translation, or help get one started


20:15

hey wizzy

yes?

would addbiblio.pl be the same code in 3.0.x and 2.2.x?

maybe the revelation is that addbiblio.pl needs to be reverted to a 2.2.9 version

20:35

chris_n
what she said


20:35

I find it highly unlikely that the two would be the same

well... you have a weird problem, and an even wierder code congruency on possibly completely different versions


20:37

wizzyrea
that's just a recipe for wierdness if I've ever heard one


20:37

mgcleveland_
hahaha


20:37

mgcleveland_
is there anywhere in the source code/DB where I can see which version I have?


20:37

* wizzyrea
does not know 2.2.9


20:37

mgcleveland_
btw, we also have a weird theme, so everything is hard to find


20:37

mgcleveland_
what about in 3.0.x?


20:37

wizzyrea
mg, which library do you work for?


20:38

mgcleveland_
I'm suspicious that we actually are running 3.0.x


20:38

mgcleveland_
University of Arizona


20:38

mgcleveland_
I'm a student


20:38

mgcleveland_
:)


20:38

chris_n
mgcleveland: you can try opening your production addbiblio.pl in a text editor and see if the version is noted there


20:38

wizzyrea
O.o Ah


20:38

mgcleveland_
I have root access to the code


20:38

mgcleveland_
i'll just check the code directly


20:38

chris
go to the about.pl page


20:38

http://your.staff.interface/cgi-bin/koha/about.pl


20:38

mgcleveland_
chris!


20:38

mgcleveland_
nice!


20:38

* chris_n
jumps back into the CSS pool for more fun


20:39

chris
and/or look in the db


20:39

mgcleveland_
it is 2.2.9


20:39

mgcleveland_
I think our theme has no link to about.pl


20:39

mgcleveland_
>(


20:39

chris
systempreferences table has a version number (if its 3.0.0 or later)


20:39

wizzyrea
aside, I didn't realize uni of ariz. was doing much with koha


20:39

mgcleveland_
it's a special project


20:39

mgcleveland_
I'm not working on the library's main site


20:40

mgcleveland_
it's a grant we've been working on for a few years


20:40

mgcleveland_
partnering with Kabul University in Afghanistan


20:40

chris
what you should do


20:40

chris
is get someone working on translate.koha.org


20:40

mgcleveland_
we do have them doing that


20:40

mgcleveland_
at least we started on it


20:41

wizzyrea
and move it to 3.0 (or 3.2, which is relatively imminent)


20:41

mgcleveland_
we're a little overwhelmed with work and fulfilling the grant expectations


20:41

chris
yeah


20:41

mgcleveland_
agreed


20:41

chris
http://translate.koha.org/fa/  hasnt changed in a while


20:41

mgcleveland_
not farsi


20:41

mgcleveland_
persian


20:41

mgcleveland_
or is it listed as farsi?


20:41

mgcleveland_
I can't remember


20:41

mgcleveland_
I don't do the farsi stuff


20:42

mgcleveland_
my boss and some coworkers do that


20:42

chris
that is persian


20:42

mgcleveland_
my favorite languages are C, C++, etc...


20:42

mgcleveland_
:)


20:43

chris
i think its a bit late now, but i suspect this a good example of why getting involved in the community early vs later is a good idea


20:43

mgcleveland_
yeah


20:43

wizzyrea
yes, definitely, a very good example


20:43

mgcleveland_
well this was working for a long time


20:43

chris
*nod*


20:43

mgcleveland_
and suddenly isn't


20:43

wizzyrea
... what changed?


20:44

mgcleveland_
I'm not sure


20:44

chris
and if it had been committed back (the translation etc) then 3.0 would have it


20:44

mgcleveland_
I wish i knew!


20:44

mgcleveland_
oh you're talking about the translation


20:44

chris
and any code mods


20:44

mgcleveland_
is that the project that uses pootle?


20:44

chris
silos = bad


20:45

chris
mgcleveland_: yeah we use pootle for translating koha


20:45

* chris
is currently translation manager


20:45

mgcleveland_
gotcha, yeah like I said I'm not involved with the translation part


20:45

mgcleveland_
maybe you've spoken with my boss then, I know he contacted someone about it


20:45

mgcleveland_
Yan Han is his name


20:46

wizzyrea
do a lot of people have superlibrarian access? or access to the system?


20:46

owen

20:46

mgcleveland_

20:47

mgcleveland_

20:47

I wonder if PTFS will continue "Koha Express?"


21:14

owen
On the one hand, it seems to fill a need for small libraries who don't want to invest too much


21:14

wizzyrea
I hope they at least give it a different name


21:14

owen
On the other hand, PTFS doesn't have to compete in the same way LibLime [felt they] did


21:15

wizzyrea
always makes me think of coffee


21:16

sekjal
I'm still keen to get a turnkeylinux application of Koha going on.  Download, slap on some (virtual) machine somewhere, and play

I think the difficulty is in the details with that, though
