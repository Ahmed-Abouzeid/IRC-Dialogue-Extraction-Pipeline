bigbrother is watching u


18:27

chris
the client or the server?


18:30

chris
to use the client u have to start the daemon, then make sure u have marc switched on in system preferences .. go to acquisitions, search on title, choose add new, then u should be at a page that has a z3950 search button on it


18:30

chris
if u type an isbn number into the isbn number box on that page


18:30

chris
and hit z3950 search, off it will go


18:31

chris
oh, in admin/parameters .. you will need to have set up a list of z39.50 servers to use


18:31

chris
z3950-daemon-launch.sh is the script to start the daemon


18:32

chris
it lives in /usr/local/koha/intranet/scripts/z3950daemon


18:32

chris
if /usr/local/koha is where u installed koha


05:24

05:25

05:25

05:25

05:26

paul
what about changing my status to project admin on sf ?


05:26

chris

05:26

chris

05:26

paul
ok, if you do it now, i'll add veleda as commiter


05:26

paul
and the 2.1.1 will have a new module to print barcodes ;-)


05:26

paul
(i've read their code, it's clean. really=


05:26

paul
)


05:27

chris
for the changing language thing .. im working on a nice way so it only shows u the languages that are available in the theme ur in


05:27

paul
nice.


05:27

paul
there's a sub  for this in systempreferences.pl


05:27

chris
excellent ill use that :(


05:27

chris
:-) even


05:28

paul
getalllanguages


05:29

paul
it's in C4::Search.pm


05:29

chris
try that


05:29

paul
(don't ask me why, i'm not the author ;-) )


05:29

paul
ok, i leave for lunch. My friend is here.


05:29

chris
ahh that might be a different thing


05:29

chris
i think thats for the catalogue, ie the language a book is published in


05:29

chris
have a good lunch


05:30

paul_lunc
no


05:30

chris
right .. in that case i might see what calls it and move it out of Search.pm


05:30

chris
cos i thought it was for the catalogue since it was in there


05:31

chris
put it in C4::Koha instead


05:32

chris
since Search.pm will die when the new fast search comes along


05:32

chris
anyway, ill talk to you later, and ur now an admin
