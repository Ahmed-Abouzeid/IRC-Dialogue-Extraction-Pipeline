[12:30] <Funto> Kaella is a french versio nof Knoppix
[12:30] <Funto> and that script permits it to connect in 30 seconds...
[12:30] <bascule> AlphaXero: yes
[12:30] <Funto> bascule >> in fact I managed to make the system recognize the modem
[12:31] <Funto> and it thinks it works

[12:32] <Funto> hmm
[12:32] <Funto> however the Kaella script works either with 2.4 and with 2.6...

[02:35] <_|Immanewbie|_> s1amson I have never heard about alinux virus at least in the windows concept (some program that infects you and you cant see it)
[02:35] <Seq> Gul3: it could be a system process in the background (like updatedb or something). open a terminal, and run `top`
[02:35] <s1amson> first written was a trojan, and i could be wrong.... but its atleast 5 years old, and actually comes with a 'disinfect' command for the end user

[02:37] <Gul3> Seq, i'm not get you here
[02:37] <Gul3> type P?
[02:37] <Seq> Gul3: just "P" while top is running, and it will sort by processor usage
[02:37] <mebaran151> do I have to add them to a special group
[02:37] <s1amson> Gul3: try ps ux (for your user only) and 'ps aux' will list all

[02:38] <bascule> not sounding too healthy, do you have front and rear usb ports? If so try the other way

[02:40] <Gul3> free up some cpu load
[02:40] <s1amson> ahh
[02:40] <arbeck> bascule:  I wonder if I can fix it in OSX or on an XP box
[02:40] <Seq> Gul3: there is a column labelled "%CPU". By typing "P" into top, you're sorting by that column. You can look down and find the process using the most cpu, and see what it is (under the "command" column)
[02:40] <arbeck> bascule:  and then try to mount it here
[02:40] <Gul3> it says 100% without any apps running
[02:40] <s1amson> think top is the only cmd line tool that will give you an active cup list
[02:40] <s1amson> cpu*
[02:40] <ubuntu2u> hey
[02:41] <ubuntu2u> does ubuntu have telnet?
[02:41] <s1amson> could be wrong

[04:34] <LinuxJones> ubuntu2u, you can't run any windows applications on Linux easily
[04:34] <gaatmx> Sorry if this is a FAQ but: Is there a way to add an application to the Menu?
[04:34] <Pinguvin> right click and add locator or something like that
[04:34] <mpq> yes, that's why you get the equivalent programs for most apps
[04:35] <ubuntu2u> linuxjones, i don't think it is the files... i think there is something else messed up
[04:35] <bc> right click in Firefox doesn't give me any options for wallpaper in ubuntu
[04:35] <ubuntu2u> i'll tell you the errormessage
[04:35] <membreya> I'm trying to add an applet..and slowly going crazy
[04:35] <mpq> anyone know of a program that would cycle through wallpapers?
[04:35] <bc> actually I can't understand why it's so hard to set background pictures.
[04:35] <Pinguvin> its not hard..?
[04:36] <moyogo> bc: it does in hoary
[04:36] <bc> should be able to right click on any image, but no, have to use the "change desktop background" thing and do a lot of browsing
[04:36] <ubuntu2u> linuxjones, the title of the window is "can't display location" and then then it says couldn't display home/liam/****(**** is the file name) then under that it says "there was an error launching the application"
[04:36] <GammaRay> one thing I never did in IE was set the background
[04:36] <ubuntu2u> if anyone else know the problem please help
[04:36] <Pinguvin> <bc> you got a point there
[04:37] <GammaRay> bc: you can drage it to the dialog AFAIK

[04:37] <bc> yes, but there's seems to be a very short limit to the number of images allowed in there
[04:37] <ubuntu2u> can anyone help me?
[04:37] <ubuntu2u> plz
[04:38] <bc> drag something in, something else leaves
[04:38] <Pinguvin> ubuntu2u: whats the files extension
[04:38] <bc> wish the image viewer had a "set as background" option at least
[04:38] <moyogo> ubuntu2u: what exactly are you trying to run?
[04:39] <LinuxJones> ubuntu2u, programs that run on Microsoft products (like Windows 95, 98 2000, XP) will not run in Linux.
[04:39] <moyogo> bc: some image viewers do
[04:39] <moyogo> bc: gthumb does for example
[04:39] <membreya> anyone know an EASY way (short of programming) to get an applet into the gnome panel???
[04:39] <bc> yes, I imagine I just have to stop being lazy and check the repositories.
[04:39] <bc> but I'm surprised gnome doesn't just build this in
[04:40] <bc> thanksd moyogo!
[04:42] <membreya> noone here plays around with applets? :(
[04:42] <ubuntu2u> moyogo, i am trying to run anything... is there a linux website that i can go to download linux stuff to try it?
[04:42] <bc> weird, Synaptic tells me I have gtthumb installed, but I don't know where the heck it is
[04:42] <moyogo> membreya: do you mean progamming applets?
[04:42] <lunitik> membreya: not entirely sure what you mean? right click "add to panel"?
[04:43] <Pinguvin> bc: run application > gthumb
[04:43] <mpq> ubuntu2u: try downloading firefox 1.0
[04:43] <bc> really noob here, is gtthumb simply what's showing me the (really  great) thumbnails in Nautilus?

[04:45] <lunitik> membreya: then my guess is the person that wrote it will have to make it a functional applet  :/

[05:14] <s1amson> anyone got experience in here with an audigyLS card?
[05:15] <bc> that's the painful irony, i recently took out my SB live card, to use the usb2 thing
[05:15] <bc> guess I'll put it back in

[05:19] <Pinguvin> what is alsa yhassnt?
[05:19] <linux_galore> many people have the cards setup wrong I find ie they have auto IRQ set on the jumpers on the card and that can create a IRQ conflict with Linux/Windows

[05:20] <inc> yeah well how about crystal audio?
[05:21] <Pinguvin> tritium: my parallel ports are not used
[05:21] <bc> this is my untested, incompetent theory about usb2 audio in linux:  somehow data's going through as if it were usb1
[05:21] <tritium> Pinguvin, okay.  You disabled them?
[05:21] <bc> and thus distorting
[05:21] <Pinguvin> no.. i mean.. i never use them :p
[05:21] <linux_galore> bc: Im finding USB audio in Linux is one of those things that needs work
[05:21] <tritium> Pinguvin, yes, but is the "lp" module loaded?
[05:22] <Pinguvin> tritium: i have no idea..?
[05:22] <tritium> Pinguvin, "lsmod | grep lp"
[05:22] <bc> linux_galore, that's a relief to hear.  ok, no more farting around, back in goes the Live value card

=== tweek888 [~tweek@pcp03808786pcs.indstr01.fl.comcast.net]  has joined #ubuntu

[05:23] <tweek888> anyone know how to get flash working =\
[05:23] <Pinguvin> tritium: any idea how i turn it off?
[05:23] <tritium> Pinguvin, you can often disable in BIOS
[05:24] <linux_galore> bc: I use USB audio only for VoIP and in that case sound quality doesnt matter much its mono with a 200-1200hz range
[05:24] <tritium> Pinguvin, or, you can boot with kernel option "acpi_irq_isa=7"
[05:24] <thundrcleeze> tweek888, sudo apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla
[05:24] <thundrcleeze> that and other facts are available at www.ubuntuguide.org

[05:24] <tweek888> thanks
[05:25] <thundrcleeze> np
[05:25] <tritium> Pinguvin, okay, that doesn't disable the parallel port, but it might solve your sound problem.  No guarantees, though.

[05:33] <crimsun> Pinguvin: snd-atiixp? That's an easy problem, more lengthy (but easy) to fix.

[05:39] <Pinguvin> crimson: thank you... i'll keep you updated :)

[05:39] <CubicllyContaine> lsof is to large and hard to understand for me to pinpoint it...
[05:40] <CubicllyContaine> but it is a bit annoying... considering it writes 20k or so every 4 sec on the dot.

[06:01] <CubicllyMinded> linux_galore, cool... just getting a feel for bugs.
[06:01] <NuuB> crimsun: all i needed to do was remove the gateway address which ubuntu set by default during the install (your suggestion that it was in network settings pointed me in the right direction and it wasn't too long before i figred out that it was the gateway address)
[06:01] <linux_galore> CubicllyMinded: usb sound needs work though
[06:01] <da_bon_bon> to upgrade to hoary, must i do a upgrade, or a dist-upgrade

[06:44] <slave> jimbob, i got it to edit, i can install anything, except csh and tcsh
[06:45] <oficina> moyogo: You might get mad at me by what I'm about to say. To be honest, I'm currently trying to do this installation in Mandrake 10.1, not Ubuntu.    I have Ubuntu installed too, but I've heard it's a big hassle to get KDE working. Not to mention this thing. However, I have gotten used to finding very knowledgeable and helpful people at this channel, so I apologize if I'm abusing of your help

[06:45] <oficina> moyogo: It is a cousin of storage. Except it integrates directly into every single app open/save dialog box, making it very useful to implement it with computerphobe users.
[06:46] <oficina> moyogo: storage is more like a natural search engine/winfs/spotlight field, but it does not let you manage the files per se.
[06:47] <oficina> moyogo: ...at least, as far as I know
[06:47] <oficina> moyogo: I'm pulling my hair already! I tell you, I've been at least 10 hours tyring to get this to install.
[06:47] <moyogo> oficina: true... i hope we go in that direction
[06:47] <moyogo> oficina: it seems rather annoying, eh
[06:48] <oficina> moyogo: what is annoying?

[06:50] <oficina> moyogo: ...meaning, how do I add the path
[06:50] <oficina> moyogo: ok, I think I found a way
[06:51] <NuuB> i thought i installed apache2 but i tried both "apachectl status" and "httpd -V" at the command line (as sudo) and it returned "command not found" both times - where am i going wrong?
[06:51] <oficina> PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin

[07:09] <cindux> Anyone knoe if theirs a command or something that basically removes all history?
[07:09] <tweek_> stupid*
[07:09] <tweek_> how do i get root on my ubuntu?
[07:09] <farruinn> tweek_: use sudo, and read the RootSudo wiki page
[07:09] <Amaranth> tweek_: use sudo
[07:09] <tweek_> thanks :)
[07:09] <oficina> moyogo: Ok, part 2 out of 3 has been completed (about 12 thorny hours later, but hey, at least there's movement forward)
[07:10] <cindux> tweek_ also if you want to have an entire session as root
[07:10] <cindux> instead of typing sudo each command
[07:10] <cindux> sudo su
[07:10] <tweek_> can i set myself to root by default?
[07:10] <xskoulax> is hoary going to use x-org?
[07:10] <Amaranth> it already does
[07:10] <tweek_> so whenever i log in im root
[07:10] <farruinn> tweek_: that is a very bad idea
[07:10] <tweek_> howso?
[07:10] <xskoulax> Amaranth, was that directed at me?
[07:11] <Amaranth> tweek_: Any bug in any application can wipe our your entire harddrive if you're running as root.
[07:11] <farruinn> there is the root terminal option in Computer>system> or somesuch, but generally being root all the time isn't good
[07:11] <Amaranth> xskoulax: Yeah.
[07:11] <xskoulax> thx Amaranth
[07:11] <cindux> he lies
[07:11] <tweek_> ok
[07:11] <cindux> log in as root amsp
[07:11] <cindux> lol
[07:11] <tweek_> il jsut do sudo su
[07:11] <moyogo> oficina: yeah the make install seems fine too
[07:12] <Amaranth> tweek_: Most of the Windows worms and trogans and such wouldn't work as well or at all if people didn't run as Administrator there. Same thing applies for Linux systems.
[07:12] <Amaranth> tweek_: sudo -s -H
[07:12] <cindux> neato
[07:12] <tweek_> ok ive gained root and im still getting the same error =\
[07:13] <Amaranth> tweek_: That gives you are root terminal and sets your $HOME variable to the correct value.

[07:18] <oficina> moyogo: Before I go on, I want your expert opinion. The Readme file suggests downloading the source code for the KDE libraries the author used *at the time* of creating the software. Should I use current source code, or should I hunt the old version?

[07:18] <tweek_> ok

[07:21] <tweek_> ok
[07:22] <moyogo> oficina: actually this should work with any kde 3.x
[07:23] <oficina> moyogo: To be honest, I really don't know how I could find that out. What I do know though, is that the KDE project source code is many times larger than the Linux kernel itself. That's enough to put me off

[07:44] <calamari> decklin: yeah, I think so.. :)  shfs seems like it'd be really cool, though
[07:45] <Amaranth> shfs?
=== decklin reads the installation guide
[07:45] <calamari> Amaranth: if I can get it to compile, it should allow me to mount a remote filesystem via ssh
[07:45] <decklin> it looks like you can simply install kernel-headers-2.6.10-whatever and compile the module outside of the kernel source tree
[07:45] <LucaBrasi> guys whats the main difference in ubuntu .. other words, why aren't there million+ distros out there sufficient? what's new/better in ubuntu?
[07:45] <GammaRay> Xenguy: I was just mentioning that perhaps the HPUX server might not let me ping as my own box does not. Then I discovered ping was just not in my PATH. problem solved.
[07:46] <decklin> or should be able to. i don't know why their makefile doesn't have the rule that their documentation is telling you to run.

[07:47] <Drizzt321> I am looking to try installing ubuntu onto an amd64(with the amd64 version) on the new nforce4 motherboard. I have 2 sata disks on the nvidia ports with nvraid in raid0, however the sata_nv does not see it as '1' disk, but the 2 seperate ones. anyone else run into this problem? anyone hear anything about this issue?
[07:47] <crimsun> decklin: yes, 0.35-1 is in universe.
[07:47] <mebaran> I am easily confused
[07:48] <decklin> crimsun: try doing it that way.
[07:48] <crimsun> calamari: ^^
[07:48] <calamari> decklin: not sure.. downloading the linux-headers package so synaptic is busy atm
[07:48] <Xenguy> GammaRay: or as a cron job (?)
[07:48] <mebaran> Drizzt321, I had the same problem
[07:48] <mebaran> the problem is
[07:48] <mebaran> nvraid is really software raid
[07:48] <tweek888> is xmms just like winamp or music only?
[07:48] <Drizzt321> mebaran: yea, the nvraid is pretty much software
[07:48] <mebaran> with a speical windows driver
[07:48] <mebaran> we dont have a linux driver yet
[07:48] <mebaran> to read the bios
[07:49] <Drizzt321> mebaran: oh. my. so basically it don't work on linux.
[07:49] <mebaran> so you cant run the raid that way
[07:49] <mebaran> yeah
[07:49] <GammaRay> ~> crontab -e
[07:49] <GammaRay> crontab: you are not authorized to use cron.  Sorry.
[07:49] <Drizzt321> mebaran: damnit. well, thanks.
[07:49] <GammaRay> ouch
[07:49] <mebaran> just use the linux kernel raid
[07:49] <mebaran> or use dynamic disks
[07:49] <Drizzt321> mebaran: ermm...won't work. this would be dual boot
[07:49] <Xenguy> GammaRay: ah well
[07:49] <mebaran> dynamic disks
[07:49] <mebaran> can be over partitions
[07:49] <farruinn> wow, people need to learn to hit enter less in this channel
[07:49] <mebaran> and linux usually has the modules to read them
[07:49] <Xenguy> farruinn: heh
[07:49] <Drizzt321> mebaran: hrm?
[07:49] <mebaran> oh
[07:50] <calamari> decklin: synaptic says "0.35-1 (warty)" in the versions tab
[07:50] <mebaran> If you are running XP, you have a kernel raid
[07:50] <mebaran> just like Linux has a kernel raid
[07:50] <Drizzt321> mebaran: hmm...maybe NCQ is not worth the overhead of the software raid...so perhaps the silicon image raid would be better?
[07:50] <Drizzt321> mebaran: ahhh, gotcha, thats how it does it.
[07:50] <mebaran> kernel raid is doable just in a partition
[07:50] <mebaran> Silicon Raid hs the exact same problem
[07:51] <mebaran> except I think redhat has a utility to work with the raid bios
[07:51] <mebaran> it would be a pain to load and install though
[07:51] <Drizzt321> mebaran: both are pretty much completely in software?
=== marco [~marco@host-200-56-121-147.block.alestra.net.mx]  has joined #ubuntu
[07:51] <decklin> calamari: appears to be the latest version. install that and shfs-utils. the -source package should have instructions on building .debs (you'll need kernel-headers installed of course)
[07:51] <mebaran> very much so
[07:51] <Drizzt321> mebaran: crap.
[07:51] <mebaran> hardware raid
[07:51] <mebaran> is very very expensive
[07:51] <mpq> xmms doesn't play mpeg-4 audio does it?
[07:51] <marco> how can i install xmms on my ubuntu
[07:52] <tweek888> i think it is
[07:52] <tezza> how would i mount a smb share so that a specific user can have read/write to it?
[07:52] <Drizzt321> mebaran: yea, I know. I just thought the SI chip would mask it a bit better. I know that on my old board my promise controller(for ide) would 'hide' the fact that it was seperate disks. or was that just the linux driver working?
[07:52] <mebaran> Drizzt321, but kernel raid is better anyway
[07:52] <mpq> marco: open a terminal, and type "sudo apt-get install xmms"
[07:52] <mpq> without the quotes
[07:52] <mebaran> promise might store the driver in bios
[07:52] <mebaran> the nv and SI drivers
[07:52] <mebaran> are in the kernel
[07:52] <calamari> decklin: yeah.. it says to type "make deb".. but that fails in the same way as "make"
[07:52] <mebaran> promise may have managed to put in directly in the bios code
[07:52] <mebaran> so that when you made a hdd call
[07:52] <decklin> tezza: mount -o 'uid=1234,gid=56789' ...
[07:53] <Drizzt321> mebaran: the odd part is, I think I noticed that, at least under windows, the response with disk access was actually a whole lot less...which I thought was odd
[07:53] <Drizzt321> mebaran: but this explains alot
[07:53] <tweek888> mpq is the synaptic packedge manager close to the effect as " sudo apt-get"?
[07:53] <mebaran> it would call the bios
[07:53] <mebaran> which would call the driver
[07:53] <mebaran> probably hard to do
[07:53] <farruinn> tweek888: yeah, synaptic and apt are both frontends to dpkg
[07:53] <mebaran> but it would then be universally platform able

[07:54] <Drizzt321> mebaran: heh, yea, but why would anyone want to do that
[07:54] <mebaran> just use kernel raid
[07:54] <decklin> calamari: are you sure you should be calling make directly? building modules packages generally involves going through debian/rules.
[07:54] <mpq> I think it's the same thing
[07:54] <mebaran> it does the same job
=== membreya is away

[07:55] <crimsun> mebaran: sound stuff is lost in the scroll, it's easier if you join #alsa
[07:55] <Drizzt321> mebaran: since when I'm doing multiple access read/write to the disks, it just slows everything else down
[07:55] <marco> i already did that
[07:55] <mebaran> cool
[07:55] <mebaran> did not know that
[07:55] <mebaran> thanks
[07:55] <marco> but the terminal says than the package isnt available

[07:56] <marco> but also says that there's another package that references xmms
[07:56] <calamari> decklin: that's what the instructions say to do.. they don't mention Debian anywhere.
[07:56] <calamari> decklin: actually, the package wit hte sources doesn't even have docs at all, except a changelog
[07:56] <calamari> terr the debian package with the sources
[07:57] <calamari> man I can't type straight right now.. sorry
[07:58] <decklin> did you untar /usr/src/shfs-whatever.tar.gz?
[07:58] <decklin> you may need to look in modules/shfs/debian there.

[08:25] <linux-rulz> Orcrist: you have to download acrobat reader for Linux from Adobe's website
[08:25] <mindphasr> fsc: Go ahead and write a about window if you like
[08:25] <fsc> Orcrist, I just installed Hoary just so I could use evince
[08:25] <Orcrist> linux-rulz, right:  you must have used the tutorial for ubuntu
[08:25] <Jimbob> linusthepenguin: To ensure you're using mod_php, you need to install libapache2-mod-php4
[08:25] <mindphasr> fsc: It does open a browser. It's a link to file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html\
[08:25] <mindphasr> fsc: It does open a browser. It's a link to file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html
[08:26] <fsc> mindphasr, ok, you're right
[08:26] <fsc> mindphasr, my bad.  i thought it would do what About Gnome does
[08:26] <Jimbob> linusthepenguin: It should put "php4.conf" and "php4.load" symlinks in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
[08:26] <Orcrist> fsc, does evince let you do that kind of thing? it really made me mad that I had to print them and then fill them in by hand, when the whole reason I d/l the pdf was to have clean forms that were typed in
[08:26] <linux-rulz> Orcrist: no, i just went to xfce.org, clicked on graphical installers and it sent me to another site and then it said there what order to do them in
[08:26] <fsc> hah, i didn't even see it open
[08:26] <Jimbob> linusthepenguin: Then it's just a matter of restarting apache2.
[08:27] <fsc> Orcrist,  the evince guys seem to be on the ball as gpdf development stagnated so you might want to give it a try.  it's like 500k download if you're on Hoary
[08:27] <Orcrist> well, linux-rulz, if you did it that way there shouldn't be a whole lot of difference... the ubuntu tutorial basically tells you the same thing as the xfce one does but it's a little more intuitive
[08:27] <Jimbob> linusthepenguin: For php-cgi, you need to ensure cgi.load/conf symlinks exist in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.
[08:27] <Orcrist> fsc, not on hoary yet... just going to wait until april to upgrade
[08:27] <Jimbob> linusthepenguin: I'd recommend mod_php, personally.
[08:27] <Orcrist> but when I go there I'll give it a look
[08:27] <Orcrist> sounds nice
[08:27] <Jimbob> linusthepenguin: It's faster than php-cgi.
[08:28] <linux-rulz> hmmmm....oh well, i was more curious than anything, XFCE seems to be running fine without the optimizations, and i obviously dont notice a speed difference because i have never used it with the optimizations.
[08:29] <Orcrist> linux-rulz, on decent hardware you probably won't notice anything... I used a p2 350 box for xfce and it made a significant difference
[08:29] <Orcrist> if you've got a fairly modern system, you're probably just fine without the tweaks
[08:29] <linux-rulz> AMD Athlon XP 2200+ with 512 MB RAM, so it is fairly good, albeit a bit dated
[08:29] <Orcrist> I like xfce though... nice and clean... very light
=== FLeiXiuS [~Nick@pcp0011094024pcs.essex01.md.comcast.net]  has joined #ubuntu
[08:30] <Orcrist> the interfaces are less than intuitive for some things... but I've yet to find an interface from windows to gnome to kde to fluxbox to whatever that has everything down pat... interfaces are a matter of personal preference
[08:31] <linux-rulz> Orcrist: exactly, i like the way it autohides the taskbars...it just seems cleaner than the windows, kde and gnome ways of doing it. There probably isnt much difference. probably just my imagination
[08:31] <Orcrist> linux-rulz, you can also use cool things like gdesklets on xfce... it's compliant
[08:32] <FLeiXiuS> Orcrist: you can use gdesklets also on gnome ;-)
[08:32] <Orcrist> so you can get a little eye candy and a slick environment and still save the overhead
[08:32] <Orcrist> aye FLeiXiuS, and I do
[08:32] <Orcrist> I was just happy to find they played nicely with xfce as well :)
[08:32] <linux-rulz> is that what they mean when they say it complies witht he freedesktop.org specs?
[08:33] <Orcrist> because the box I run it on (mostly as a backup box for when I'm in full-screen game mode and want chat/teamspeak/wahtever) only has 128 megs of RAM
[08:33] <Orcrist> with xfce running and mozilla, xchat, and teamspeak running the total commit for memory was around 70 megs
[08:33] <Orcrist> and used next to zero swap
[08:33] <linux-rulz> Ubuntu should offer a trimmed down version of Ubuntu with XFCE called "Ubuntu Lite" or something like that for people with slower computers
[08:34] <NuuB> Jimbob: it came back with "Package apache2-mpm-prefork is not available, but is referred to by another package."
[08:34] <Orcrist> linux-rulz, you may see ubuntu offer something like that in the future... they try to focus on ergonomics and user-friendliness

[08:34] <FLeiXiuS> I love the install for slackware, one of the bests out there
[08:34] <Orcrist> I wouldn't be suprised to see an installer with options for one of 3 or 4 window managers as default in the future.. but right now they're focusing all their support on gnome
[08:35] <jdub> Orcrist: that won't happen
[08:35] <jdub> however
[08:35] <FLeiXiuS> Not only was it nice, but it alowed you to select between 7-8 window managers
[08:35] <jdub> kubuntu is coming
[08:35] <Orcrist> oh really, jdub?
[08:35] <Orcrist> that's very cool
[08:35] <jdub> FLeiXiuS: that certainly won't be happening in ubuntu
[08:35] <Orcrist> I figured you guys were getting around to adding other things
[08:35] <farruinn> haha, which is the polar opposite of xfce ;-)
[08:36] <jdub> i think xfce sits between gnome and kde
[08:36] <linux-rulz> i dont understand why they focus so heavily on kde. most distros are already centered around kde, the ubuntu devs should instead release the XFCE Ubuntu or some other lightweight WM/DE.
[08:36] <jdub> it's light, sure, but there's a heck of a lot of clicky-clicky stuff on the screen
[08:36] <FLeiXiuS> i think flux sits between them 2
[08:36] <Orcrist> I'd be inclined to agree to that, jdub, esp considering their "kde/gnome support engines"

[08:38] <Orcrist> you have a point daniels, but I think as an 'expert-only' option or something you get the flexibility withotu forcing the user to choose if they want a simple, intuitive install
[08:38] <farruinn> you're going to fit multiple window managers on one install cd? good luck
[08:38] <linux-rulz> lol, donate money...cause i couldnt code if my life depended on it. all my code would be rewritten cause i would do it shitty (lol, at least im honest)

[08:48] <jdub> linux-rulz: no, donating is less effective. you know that i don't code, right? :-)
[08:49] <Orcrist> linux-rulz, contributing can be something as small as accurately documenting a bug when you find it and submitting it to a respective package/distro's bugzilla

[08:57] <daniels> IRCMonkey_: should just work by default -- mine (also vt8235) certainly did
[08:57] <tweek_> and one period.
[08:57] <Orcrist> lol not suggesting that :)  I was suggesting that the default install could do just waht the default install does now... but another 'custom' option would allow you to select something like fce-only.. without having apt-get the stuff

[08:57] <tweek_> watch out

[11:53] <desplesda> thanks anyway
[11:54] <NuuB> lunitik: crap. i dont want the whole blasted desktop removed
[11:54] <lunitik> NuuB: nah... just the meta-package 'ubuntu-desktop' will be removed...
[11:55] <lunitik> NuuB: It may cause issues when you upgrade to hoary though...
[11:55] <NuuB> lunitik: i'm a novice, you say desktop, i hear whole-damn-GUI
[11:56] <lunitik> NuuB: I tried to make that distinction but putting it in quotes  :P
[11:57] <ssamf> it is just a meta package
[11:57] <Tsjoklat> he just horribly failed :)
[11:57] <lunitik> Tsjoklat: no one asked you, shush  :P
[11:57] <ssamf> it contains nothing but depends on everything you need for a desktop
=== Tsjoklat goes pout
=== Ivy6Quaff [~Sir@c906300c.virtua.com.br]  has joined #ubuntu
[11:57] <NuuB> lol, "meta package" may have meaning to you, none to me unfortunately
[11:58] <ssamf> if you install ubuntu-desktop it will get all the other packages
[11:58] <ssamf> but uninstalling it does nothing
[11:58] <MobyTurbo> NuuB, one of the reasons why this meta-package is useful is that it will make an upgrade to Hoary do things like automatically pull in xorg.
[11:59] <MobyTurbo> right, uninstalling it deletes nothing.
[11:59] <MobyTurbo> I often delete it when I switch from totem-gstreamer to totem-xine
[11:59] <ssamf> you can for example uninstall xchat, because it is depended on by ubuntu-desktop, unless you remove ubuntu-desktop
[12:00] <lunitik> MobyTurbo: well, no... thats the responsibility of 'x-window-system-core'  :P
[12:00] <NuuB> MobyTurbo: xorg is one more thing with no meaning (not asking you to explain, just setting the bar lower so it is closer to my present level of knowledge)

[12:00] <lunitik> *nods*
[12:00] <ssamf> xorg is the replacement og xfree, which was the old graphics system
=== Tsjoklat nudges lunitik
[12:01] <NuuB> ok, can i uninstall samba (with it uninstalling the desktop), and then reinstall the desktop meta package?
[12:02] <lunitik> NuuB: well... but it will reinstall samba-common when you do so...
[12:02] <MobyTurbo> NuuB, no, reinstalling the desktop meta package will automatically pull in Samba
=== ami666 [~ami@195.245.214.54]  has left #ubuntu [] 
[12:02] <ssamf> no, if you reinstall ubuntu-desktop, it will go "oh, you need samba for a complete desktop" and install it
[12:02] <NuuB> ssamf: ok, xorg eq newer xfree - that i get
[12:03] <ssamf> meta packages are good, because they let you install loads of stuff with one command
=== fiacca [~fiacca@host137-153.pool8254.interbusiness.it]  has joined #ubuntu
[12:04] <NuuB> i dont care right now if i have samba or not, i may care later, but right now i just want to finsh the installs i had been doing beforehand

[12:04] <fiacca> ciao a tutti
[12:04] <Tsjoklat> bacamilli!
[12:04] <ssamf> so you install the meta package, then remove the meta package, and you have everything

[12:06] <ssamf> yes
[12:06] <Cam-> what was that about?

[12:08] <ssamf> about meta packages
[12:08] <ssamf> specifically the ubuntu-desktop one
[12:08] <NuuB> i just tried to do a remove and it is still frozen

[12:10] <ssamf> or in synaptic right click on it and go to properties
[12:10] <Cam-> so i was curious as to what you meant
[12:10] <Cam-> ;-)
[12:10] <lunitik> ssamf: usually, meta-packages are used at a lower level in Debian... example: 'gnome' 'gnome-core' and 'gnome-environment', 'x-window-system' and 'x-window-system-core'... 'kde-core' and 'kde... etc
[12:11] <lunitik> Cam-: yeah... you want ubuntu-desktop around to make sure you are getting everything from hoary...

[12:11] <Cam-> yep
[12:11] <Cam-> ive done a clean install of warty, and dist-upgrading at the moment to hoary
[12:11] <NuuB> is it possible there is something going on like a file lock that needs removing so i can continue doing my installs with apt-get?
[12:12] <lunitik> Cam-: for instance... a bittorrent client is new to hoary... you wouldn't get that... update-monitor and update-notification are more examples of changes you might miss...

[02:17] <lunitik> vixus: look into samba
[02:17] <vixus> Ok.
[02:17] <vixus> By the way. The windows 98 pc is on the network wirelessly.
[02:17] <ogra> deepsight: there is a headers package for every ubuntu linux-image, you souldnt recompile the kernel just to get a vmware module

[02:17] <MobyTurbo> narkceh, install it using aptitude, apt-get, or synaptic, then hopefully you can run it from gdm.
[02:18] <deepsight> ogra, i know i downloaded the correct one i think but it still complained... dont have the exact error now
[02:18] <vixus> lunitik: Is there a guide on setting up? It's just, I've sucked at setting up Samba.
[02:18] <narkceh> apt-get install xfce?
[02:18] <NuuB> lunitik: what will happen when i do "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" ? (i am wondering if it will initiate some massive d/l over my lil'56k serial modem)
[02:18] <deepsight> can't i just get the default .config from somewhere?
[02:18] <deepsight> and compile with that?
[02:18] <ogra> deepsight: then you didnt download the correct ones

[02:19] <deepsight> yes
[02:19] <lunitik> NuuB: yes... those 99 packages held back will be downloaded and installed
[02:19] <vixus> Ok. Well, I'm following the samba server setup guide on ubuntuguide.org
[02:19] <ogra> deepsight: then you can use the config that is stored in /boot
[02:19] <lunitik> narkceh: no... apt-get install xfce4
[02:19] <mz2> the default cursor theme in gcursor just looks like that error image ("!")

[02:19] <lunitik> narkceh: else you get xfce, which was ugly...

[02:19] <mz2> so what package do i need to install to get it back?
[02:19] <narkceh> lunitik: ok xfce4 then
[02:20] <narkceh> how to remove gnome?
[02:20] <NuuB> lunitik: any way to know ahead of time how big a download it will entail?
[02:20] <ogra> deepsight: with other sources you will miss a lot of ubuntu specific patches.... dunno if the ubuntu .config works then

[02:21] <ogra> deepsight: but there are a lot of people using vmware in ubuntu taht didnt recompile their kernel ;)
[02:21] <MobyTurbo> xfce uses gtk now
[02:21] <deepsight> ogra, damn those ppl
[02:21] <ogra> deepsight: if you give the right options to make-kpkg ....
[02:21] <vixus> lunitik: I think I've done the linux side of things, how do I do the Windows side?
[02:21] <lunitik> MobyTurbo: yes... but this is the reason there are still 2 packages... xfce = xforms ; xfce4 = gtk2
[02:22] <lunitik> vixus: just share stuff  :/
[02:22] <MobyTurbo> lunitik, OK
[02:22] <deepsight> ogra, i followed the Wiki tutorial in ubuntu webpage...
[02:22] <deepsight> ogra, but ill try again with the headers
[02:22] <vixus> lunitik: What do you mean just share stuff?
[02:22] <deepsight> let me give you the error
[02:22] <MobyTurbo> lunitik, I actually like lyx's xforms version more than their Qt version, but I agree with you about xfce v3
[02:22] <lunitik> vixus: right click 'share'
[02:23] <vixus> On windows or linux?

[03:07] <narkceh> lunitik: huh?
[03:07] <lunitik> well... I'm guessing its X's... definatly not GNOME's though

[03:52] <Drizzt321> grub works fine as well, just a different way of doing things. I'm not expert on dual booting with grub though, unfortunately.
[03:52] <Glen_> this GRUB doesnt work, cos it didnt work onn SuSE either, and now its not working on Ubuntu so it must be GRUB

[04:05] <Psyk[o] > Drizzt321, sure
[04:05] <Drizzt321> thanks
[04:06] <mat> also, if reloading the module works: sometimes, the nvidia module compiled for an old kernel (or an old kernel configuration), would load but not work. so you could just try rebuilding the module (probably useless if you are using the packages though)

[04:30] <aaronc_uk> ahh, not sure where to get that from
[04:31] <darksatanic> You can get rid of the partition table from a Linux command prompt with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda count=1 bs=512"

[04:31] <Drizzt321> aaronc_uk: no clue, you search the net for libbluetooth and find out where its home is? start there
[04:31] <darksatanic> If you wipe the partition table totally, it should do, yes.

[05:03] <MobyTurbo> hybrid_, Linux partially complies with other standards too.
[05:03] <usual> is nautilus crashing X a known bug in hoary?
[05:03] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: I thought it was one by ratified by on of the international standards organization. like IETF or ISO or IEEE
[05:03] <zombics> topyli, build-essential is already the newest version.
[05:03] <casimir> what about SUS?
[05:04] <Drizzt321> casimir: I was just using those as examples
[05:04] <hybrid_> MobyTurbo; but not hardware sandards ;) but posix is very loose technically windows is posix...but is it unix? :P
[05:04] <MobyTurbo> Drizzt321, yes, but the Federal Government prefers POSIX when they purchase software. It's why Windows NT contained a crippled POSIX DLL.

[05:04] <hybrid_> MobyTurbo they really do? kool
[05:04] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: right, but the Federal government doesn't determine if it is a standard or not, it looks at what is out there and says we want this

[05:08] <hybrid_> Omega11 ; yea system V is obsolete
[05:08] <MobyTurbo> Linux has become better than any propritary version of Unix on the PC platform.
[05:08] <hybrid_> and if i am correct that is the newest version of unix
[05:08] <Bandit> "Linux; because a PC is a terrible thing to waste."
[05:08] <hybrid_> lol
[05:09] <Bandit> a useless operating system, copied directly from the Mac OS, which prior to that, copied it from IBM. It's sole purpose is to make users even more confused and drawing more stupid users to the Internet. see also conspiracy, microsoft, microsmurf
[05:09] <mz2> hmm i can't seem to get X.org to work with my ATi card on hoary
[05:09] <MobyTurbo> hybrid_, no, the clean-room *BSDs are newer.
[05:09] <mz2> the screen's all scrambled and the cursor's this weird box
[05:09] <Omega11> i use windows
[05:09] <Omega11> because it just works
[05:10] <Drizzt321> Omega11: sure, games always come out for windows first
[05:10] <mz2> the fglrx module doesn't work with the kernel version i'm using, it seems
[05:10] <hybrid_> MobyTurbo but they are UN*X not unix unless they got a liscence i could be wrong i dont pay much attention to BS
[05:10] <hybrid_> d
=== mjr smells a troll in our midst
[05:10] <MobyTurbo> Omega11, then go to #windows and leave us alone.
[05:10] <mz2> i've tried compiling it but it says: Makefile:50: *** mixed implicit and normal rules.  Stop.

[05:10] <Golfer> Omega11 thats why i am using Ubuntu :)
[05:10] <Drizzt321> mjr: better?
[05:10] <Omega11> tell me can you run essential software like microsoft office on your precious linux?
[05:10] <universal> Xine says maybe MRL syntax is wrong or file /stream source doesent exist when playing DVD's, why?
[05:10] <Drizzt321> Omega11: OO.org
[05:10] <hybrid_> how do you do the *blah   ?
[05:11] <MobyTurbo> hybrid_, Linux isn't Unix either by that definitition. Net2 and 4.4BSD and Linux both have no AT&T code.
[05:11] <Drizzt321> Omega11: KOffice
[05:11] <Golfer> Omega11 yes I am
[05:11] <MobyTurbo> hybrid_, shift-8
[05:11] <universal> hallo?
[05:11] <Omega11> can you play everquest two on your precious linux?
[05:11] <mjr> Drizzt321, not really; people keep feeding it and that just makes it stink up the place even more
[05:11] <Golfer> Omega11 actually I am using all the the Office Suite through linux

[05:53] <sjoerd> vixus: that's a strange bt address
[05:53] <MobyTurbo> Drizzt321, hoary is sort of a cross between testing, in that it eventually becomes stable, and unstable, in that things get broken a bit.
[05:53] <deepsight> i remember like 4 years ago i had debian unstable and weird things happened :D
[05:53] <vixus> yep
[05:53] <eKLim> hie... anyone knows how to configure USB DSL modem?
[05:53] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: ok, so its probably closer to sid/unstable in the debian world?
[05:53] <vixus> I also tried hcitool cc FoxT610
[05:53] <Golfer> Drizzt321 if your used to testing and dont mind it hoary is the way to go
[05:54] <vixus> Can't create connection: Connection timed out
[05:54] <hybrid_> is warty the first ubuntu version
[05:54] <Drizzt321> Golfer: well, I have never really found any real issue with debian/testing in terms of things breaking
[05:54] <Golfer> like i said no problems here
[05:54] <deepsight> glibc broke in old times and it was not nice
[05:54] <deepsight> ancient times
[05:54] <Drizzt321> Golfer: so you got hoary and in general use, no issues?
[05:55] <Bandit> deepsight no troubles here either
[05:55] <hybrid_> is hoary based on sarge or sid
[05:55] <deepsight> nice, so there i go
[05:55] <MobyTurbo> Drizzt321, hoary does have things breaking. If you're willing to put up with that it could be fun. Personally I'm running warty, but that's partially because I don't have broadband.
[05:55] <MobyTurbo> hybrid_, both are based on sid, except Hoary is more on the bleeding edge (stuff like xorg and gnome 2.9) than Sid.
[05:55] <Bandit> deepsight  I am running a small server on it with no problems Server Uptime 4 days, 1:53:16
[05:56] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: have you heard of things breaking all the time, or just now and then?
[05:56] <Bandit> but its what ever turns you on :)
=== HillTop [~chatzilla@dt060n09.san.rr.com]  has joined #ubuntu
[05:56] <hybrid_> MobyTurbo ; o ok so hoary is more in developement then sid
[05:56] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: since I kind of want newer than debian/testing, but I don't think I'm ready for bleeding edge released yesterday kind of thing
[05:56] <deepsight> Bandit, ok ill adventure and see what happens, what i want to see is if it supports my usb external hd cradle
[05:56] <MobyTurbo> Drizzt321, things break constantly, but nothing so bad that you have to reinstall like sid used to do.
[05:57] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: ahhh. would it make more sense to install warty, and see if I want to upgrade to hoary then?
[05:57] <MobyTurbo> Drizzt321, of course, that doesn't mean that *can't* happen...
[05:57] <Drizzt321> MobyTurbo: heh, indeed.
[05:57] <MobyTurbo> Drizzt321, sure. You can always dist-upgrade.

[06:36] <TSWoodV> scoon, all is good. ACPI is actually working as it should (hallelujah!).  It's just the age old problem of esd hogging /dev/dsp.  And that's even with alsa installed.  One of the days it just might get sorted out...
[06:36] <darkcmd> where can I get some ubuntu screenshots?
[06:36] <darkcmd> also, does ubuntu use the standard debian repositories?

[06:37] <binks> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/screenshots/document_view
[06:37] <darkcmd> does it use ubuntu specific repositories>
[06:37] <TSWoodV> darkcmd, ubuntu uses the debian repos.  Just be careful that you don't run apt-get dist-upgrade.  You'll be back to debian stock in no time...
[06:37] <drasko> darkcmd, no, it has it't own,
[06:37] <darkcmd> so it uses it's own or the debian ones?
[06:38] <drasko> darkcmd,  but you can add any repository you want...
[06:38] <Agrajag> TSWoodV: what, no it doesn't
[06:38] <TSWoodV> darkcmd, drasko is correct in that there are specific ubuntu repos.  You can add the debian ones back in in just about amount you'd like.
[06:38] <Agrajag> you CAN, but you shouldn't, and they're not in sources.list unless you add them yourself
[06:38] <darkcmd> nah i would just like to use the ubuntu ones
[06:38] <darkcmd> if I do dist upgrade with the ubunto ones
[06:38] <drasko> darkcmd, just edit /etc/apt/sources-list
[06:38] <darkcmd> am I safe
[06:39] <TSWoodV> Agrajag, I'm running universe against this hoary and am having no problems.  With the right sources.list, you'll be just fine.
[06:39] <drasko> darkcmd, I agree...
[06:39] <scoon> so, if someone added all debian repos and then did a dist-upgrade this would not be ubuntu anymore ?
[06:39] <davix> need help, I can hear music in the gnome music player, but not in the other audio applications... any ideas?
[06:39] <drasko> darkcmd, otherwise, you'll get Srage
[06:39] <scoon> could the ubuntu repos then be added back and dist-upgrade back to ubuntu
[06:39] <TSWoodV> darkcmd, there's documentation IIRC in the faq at ubuntulinux.com about this.
[06:40] <TSWoodV> davix, warty or hoary?
[06:40] <drasko> scoon, right
[06:40] <davix> hoary
[06:40] <davix> upgraded from warty
[06:40] <scoon> drasko, hmmm.  that's kinda cool
[06:40] <stuNNed_> topyli: ok! thanks! :D
[06:40] <scoon> drasko, anyone done that in here ?
[06:40] <darkcmd> TSWoodV, is warty the latest release, and is it based on sarge?
[06:40] <drasko> scoon, yes, I did it myself...
[06:40] <TSWoodV> davix, same here.  It's all related to that dreaded esd and blocking against /dev/dsp.
[06:41] <scoon> drasko, any problems ?
[06:41] <davix> TSWoodV, erm, any ideas of how to fix it?
[06:41] <topyli> stuNNed_: yeah i put something in. at least there's a link to the manual :)

[06:42] <TSWoodV> darkcmd, as it IS
[06:42] <drasko> scoon, nope... it even changes your desktop theme and your spalsh... Justa that several packages are held back and not upgraded
[06:42] <darkcmd> I'm downloading Ubunto for my dad
[06:42] <darkcmd> right now
[06:42] <davix> hoary is rather nice, will get better as it seems from this pov.
[06:43] <drasko> scoon, I still keep ubuntu repositories as well... So I've got some kind of mix on my machine... but it works great.
[06:43] <scoon> drasko, thanks.  i was always wondering about that.
[06:43] <darkcmd> what version of gnome is in the stable release atm
[06:43] <TSWoodV> davix, try Desktop -> Preferences -> Sound and uncheck the box that talks about sound server startup.  I've not checked to see what downside this has.
[06:43] <stuNNed_> topyli: good enought really the 'info' is all we need :D

[06:51] <cindux> everytime i do, start ups hang more
[06:51] <TSWoodV> cindux, see if there's a BIOS upgrade for your machinel.
[06:52] <TSWoodV> cindux, you can also add "noacpi" to your grub configuration.

[09:30] <mpq> anyone know if winamp will run with wine?
[09:30] <bob2> I wouldn't bother
[09:30] <bob2> but probably
[09:31] <mpq> I wouldn't either but it's the only player that supports mp3pro encoding
[09:31] <YankDownUnder> mpq: Why ITH would you want to run WinAMP under linux?
[09:31] <omar> has anyone ever had a problem with modifying their $PATH ??  I am installing xfce and it says in cannot find a file even though the file is there?
[09:31] <bob2> then don't do mp3 encoding
[09:31] <linuxn00b> i'm not sure what to do now, because I need these in mp3 format. :/
[09:31] <mpq> I'm not the one who did it

[09:33] <sgtshatta> how does one change their path $PATH ??
[09:33] <mebaran> the ones
[09:33] <linuxn00b> bob2, well how to I install it right I used synaptic
[09:33] <mebaran> in like /etc/alsa
[09:33] <slackd00d> how do i su - to root in ubuntu? i was never promted to enter a root password during installation
[09:33] <bob2> linuxn00b: install the "lame" package.

[09:34] <mebaran> I manually deleted every remnant of alsa
[09:34] <hybrid_> ogg
[09:34] <slackd00d> Hannes_: thanks
[09:34] <mebaran> as stated by whereis
[09:34] <bob2> mebaran: no, you don't ever delete files you don't understand, it will only break things
[09:34] <sgtshatta> slack00d: sudo su
[09:34] <mebaran> well mny sound was completely broken before
[09:34] <mebaran> now only xmms is broken
[09:34] <mebaran> I read the scripts
[09:34] <bob2> yes, and deleting them did not help

[09:35] <mebaran> bob2
[09:35] <mebaran> what would you suggest then
[09:35] <bob2> linuxn00b: if you can't run "lame" from the command line, you don't have it installed
[09:36] <mebaran> I reinstalled the alsa pakages multiple times
[09:36] <mpq> why is it called lame?
[09:36] <mebaran> and I never go sound
[09:36] <bob2> mebaran: I have no idea what your original problem was, but randoly deleting files is never a good idea
[09:36] <linuxn00b> bob2, I can run it in the command line
[09:36] <mebaran> heheh
[09:36] <bob2> mebaran: how would reinstalling them help?
[09:36] <mpq> that filename is lame
[09:36] <mebaran> I dont know
[09:36] <bob2> right
[09:36] <mebaran> I looked through everything though
[09:36] <mebaran> it was quite baffling
[09:36] <mebaran> the mixer settings were fine
[09:36] <mebaran> amixer said everything was good
[09:36] <bob2> linuxn00b: and you put the right path into grip?
[09:37] <mebaran> esd was loaded
[09:37] <bob2> ok...
[09:37] <mebaran> but still no sound
[09:37] <mebaran> so I decided maybe I should purge my system of alsa
[09:37] <linuxn00b> bob2, it just says lame
[09:37] <mebaran> and do a fresh install
[09:37] <bob2> linuxn00b: try putting the full path in there
[09:37] <mebaran> bob2, how does Ubuntu make the scripts in the first place
[09:37] <topyli> mpq: "Lame Ain't an Mp3 Encoder"? :)
[09:37] <mpq> lol
[09:37] <bob2> mebaran: if you're using OSS, it doesn't matter if they exist or not
[09:38] <linuxn00b> bob2, ok well I put in the whole path now it works thanks :)
[09:38] <mebaran> well I prefer ALSA
[09:38] <bob2> but they come from various alsa-* packages
[09:38] <bob2> so you need to purge and reinstall them
[09:38] <mebaran> because have very poor quality

[10:10] <bob2> mpq: there are ircops, but that's different
[10:10] <mebaran> seems to be setup right
[10:10] <mpq> there should be a word

[10:21] <LinuxJones> tha_gamemaster, what problem ar eyou having ?
[10:21] <vi11e> first you should check google about transforming ntfs to fat32 etc... if your ntfs is empty or useless stuff in there... then  you can do it at least

[10:24] <LinuxJones> tha_gamemaster, it has nvidia set for the video driver ?
[10:24] <moquist> Gul3: basically, you tell dd where to get data ("if"), where to put it ("of"), how big each data chunk should be ("bs", I use "bs=1M"), and how many data chunks to move ("count").
[10:25] <tha_gamemaster> LinuxJones yes, nvidia is the driver not nv, and I don't see the nvidia splash screen, also nvidia-settings doesn't work correctly.
[10:25] <moquist> Gul3: then you can tell dd how much of the input to skip ("skip") and how far to seek into the output before writing ("seek").

[11:46] <umarmung> apokryphos, for the future: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm <--- the correct way
[11:46] <Cindux> hm
[11:47] <Cindux> can anyone help with a minor ACPI issue ?
[11:47] <apokryphos> umarmung: Yup; thanks.

[11:51] <devo> bascule: i'm just trying to get the movie trailers up.  i don't have religion on what does it.
[11:51] <zenrox> raydoo_,  ask away
[11:51] <apokryphos> raydoo_: No!! Why, of course you can. =)
[11:52] <spinifex> I've got the default install of gnome on hoary.  When I hit logout, it freezes up my 'applications/places/desktop' bar, and waits about 5 minutes before asking me what type of logout I want to do
[11:52] <raydoo_> i just installed ubuntu
[11:52] <raydoo_> when it was finisied i changed my username ^^
[11:52] <raydoo_> now i cant sudo anymore
[11:52] <devo> bascule: i tried installing mplayer as it works well for my SuSE 9.1 installation but it doesn't seem to be happy in Ubuntu land.
[11:52] <bascule> devo: nor me, try this one in a console mplayer -cache 500 -playlist some.usr.you.want

[11:52] <apokryphos> raydoo_: You're no longer the primary user. You'll have to configure the new user to be one, to be able to sudo etc..
[11:52] <spinifex> raydoo_, can you still login the old account?
[11:52] <delltony> question, whats the command line for alsamixer to raise the volume i'm trying to configure lineakd to raise my pcm volume
[11:53] <raydoo_> its the primary acc with changed username
[11:53] <GammaRay> raydoo_: take a look at /etc/sudoers as your old user. duplicate the line w/ your old user, but w/ your new user
[11:53] <raydoo_> and iam no longer in sudo list
[11:53] <apokryphos> delltony: in Terminal, type "alsamixer". Can change it in there.
[11:53] <raydoo_> ok lets look
[11:53] <delltony> yeah but i need the command as in aumix -w +5 or whatever
[11:53] <sladen> GammaRay: in that case, boot into '(recovery mode)' and then edit it
[11:54] <audiored> sorry to keep spamming this question.. but.. i'm having problems installing guifications, a plugin for gaim.  anyone help me figure out what i'm doing wrong?  i've followed all the directions on the forums.. even made my own post regarding this issue.  i've tried all the suggestions and more. but it still isn't working for me.  =(
[11:54] <bascule> audiored: #gaim ?
[11:54] <delltony> ill do some more reasoning and see what i can come upu with
[11:54] <delltony> thanks
=== GammaRay rediects that to raydoo_ 
[11:54] <audiored> ok i'll ask there.  =)

[11:57] <devo> bascule: gave an "empty playlist" warning.  no dice.
[11:58] <bascule> raydoo_: root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash make a line exactly like that in /etc/passwd
[11:58] <devo> Is there a place one can get the beta hoary hedgehog .iso?
[11:58] <sladen> tweek_: it's called 'Beagle'
[11:58] <bascule> devo: try without -playlist

[11:58] <fallker> hey all
[11:58] <bestadvocate> tweek_: it would be nice if beagle could enter its results into googles homepage, just like desktop search, then we would have a fully open source solution,  best of both worlds
[11:58] <bascule> mplayer -cache 500 some.usr.you.want
[11:58] <bascule> spinifex: oh yeah, damn ..
[11:58] <jba> hey guys, is there a planet.ubuntu.org or something?
[11:59] <bestadvocate> jba:?
[11:59] <tweek_> cool
[11:59] <ssamf> can someone running hoary try something for me? run "gthumb /" from the comandline, it is consistantly crashing for me
[11:59] <jba> like with planet.gnome.org,
[11:59] <bascule> raydoo_: you can only do it from a chroot in a livecd/other distro
[11:59] <jba> found it, planet.ubuntu.com
[11:59] <raydoo_> ah ok
[11:59] <spinifex> raydoo, looks like you're gonna have to hack your own computer.  or reinstall or something.
[11:59] <bestadvocate> ssamf: it crashed on me too

[11:59] <sladen> bestadvocate: the way to do that is with a firefox plugin that hooks requests to www.google.*  ---have you suggested it as a wanted feature?
