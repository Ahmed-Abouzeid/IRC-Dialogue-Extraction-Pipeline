2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	viller	well, yes, it's a uni-directional NApT -- network address/port translation
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	Aar0n444		I know I need a command to boot ubuntu on my laptop, and I used to have it working, along with my WiFi card too. But now, I try one or two commands and the WiFi card won't work. What commands could I try to boot?
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	viller	un_operateur	so when I "map" I am forwarding ports as they call it?
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	hendrickvp	un_operateur	so i would just download and install into the corresponding files...?
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	ap0cq		hi
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	viller	map is a very loose term, isn't it? depends on what you mean, really
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	Grok_		how would i find out what the $arch (Kn) be if the cpu is listed as "Mobile AMD Athlon XP-M"?
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	hendrickvp	if you apt-get install libgd2-xpm, you should have everything you need
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	viller	un_operateur	when I'm talking about NAT commands
2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	hendrickvp		oh.... easy enough

2007-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	Keeguon		hey I'm trying to compile fleow plugin for Banshee but it says "No package 'tao-opengl' found" what can I do
2007-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	un_operateur	viller	if you implement NAT, you are not portforwarding because NAT operates with IP/Network Addresses .. but when you port-forward, you need to have a "NAT" map for the outside port to be directed to an inside address, so NAT is necessary for port-forwarding but not vice-versa

2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	atoma	The generic kernel has smp support
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	base_16	Jordan_U	only if it's compiled in

2007-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	base_16	Jordan_U	that depends on if he's talking about the default ubuntu one or if he's compiling from vanilla
2007-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	base_16		though i do believe SMP is checked on by default these days

2007-01-01T12:55:00.000Z	ubotu		LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
2007-01-01T12:55:00.000Z	lovloss		any idea why my refresh went from 81 to 55 when i installed the new nvidia driver?

2007-01-01T01:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	Using fglrx?
2007-01-01T01:03:00.000Z	phr34ck		I used to have that resolution when I was using Windows ... I think it was 1280x800 or something like that.
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	phr34ck	Jordan_U	no idea.

2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	phr34ck		How can I check >?
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	It is something you have to install yourself, so if you don't know you probably don't have the drivers :)
2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	phr34ck		I downloaded the fglrx but it's .rpm file.
2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	phr34ck		Should I use Alien to transform it to .deb file and install ?
2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	NO!
2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	Seveas	phr34ck	no

2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	It is available in the ubuntu repositories, use the instructions ubotu gave
2007-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	noldon		can i make so only minimized windows is showned in the lower panel?
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	phr34ck	Jordan_U	I think I downloaded it based on that webpage, if I remember correctly.
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	rzlist		Has anyone seen the atheros (ath_pci) module hanging a system using a Gigabyte GA-965P-DS3 motherboard using Edgy?

2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		apt ?
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	Yes.
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	base_16		why is greenland on UTC?
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	base_16	oops	wrong channel
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		I only know this: apt-get to get packages.
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		but I have no idea how it works, why it's there and the like.
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		I just know that it's used to download stuff.
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	Ok, I am just confused how you got a .rpm file?
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	byp		Anyone have any problems with devices no longer being recognized?
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	phr34ck	Jordan_U	from ati.com
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	phr34ck		They said it's the Linux driver.
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	it sounds like a module issue.. what has changed on your system?
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	you must download the .run driver
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	awilcox		Okay I have problems, first of all it's 64-bit Kubuntu, I know 64-bit distros are bad so I've heard, but just I hope you will try to help me anyways.
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	Ahh, try the ones from apt first, they install automatically and have a .deb ( using alien can mess things up )
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	awilcox	64 distros are awesome
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	byp	Well	I used shred on sda, then I partitioned and formatted it, but then it no longer was recognized, nor any other device
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	awilcox		I screwed up the mount points, /tmp got the /home partition and /home got the /tmp partition
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	wasabi_	awilcox	They aren't bad if you stick to 100% free software.
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	phr34ck	LinAsH	what's the that?
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Haldo. N00b here.
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	awilcox	look at /etc/fstab
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	phr34ck		The thing is that I don't want it to install automaticaly, I want to do it.
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	rzlist		I'm running 64 bit ubuntu.. it runs great (with the exception of the atheros driver)
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	byp		Syslog showed that it was there, recognnized, but /dev didn't show it
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	awilcox		So I mounted them to different folders, cp -r'd everything on the /tmp partiton to /home2 (the real /home parition) and rebooted
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	phr34ck		I mean, the hole idea of me switching to Linux is because I want to do everything, and so I understand what's going on.
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	awilcox		now it works, obviously, in command prompt mode
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Downloaded a LiveCD yesterday, and couldn't connect to the internet with Ubuntu...
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	LinAsH		it's a script that build the .deb package for the ati driver
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	did they show up using lsmod?
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	awilcox		but in graphics mode, when I type the password, the screen goes black and then it brings me back to the password prompt
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	byp		Let me check
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	what's your ati card ?
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	awilcox	MasterShrek	yeah I already messed with that, and I got it to mount properly
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	awilcox		I checked all the permissions and stuff like that
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	ShayGuy		I'm on a wireless connection; not sure what type the router is...
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	phr34ck	X600	
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	phr34ck		mobility
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	byp	Sorry	what exactly am I looking for with lsmod here? :P
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	phr34ck		tis a lappy.
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	In debian based systems you generally don't want to install things manually, and IMHO you probably won't learn much from it.
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	what device did you lose?
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	Latty		Happy New Year All.
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	Latty		(In England, at least)
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	awilcox		Happy New Year, Latty.  :D
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	any that were plugged in, such as sda and sdb
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	phr34ck	Jordan_U	at least I should understand how it works .. don't you think ?
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	phr34ck		I mean, how does the apt works?>
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	phr34ck		What's happening under the hood ?
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	under the hood it's calling dpkg
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	are these SATA or scsi devices?
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	phr34ck		what's that?
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	__mikem	phr34ck	all apt does is connect to the url's in your sources.list file, and finds a package file and downloadds and installs it
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	byp		OH, sorry, they're flash drives, so SCSI, I think
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	phr34ck	You would probably learn more reading the man pages ( again just my opinion ) I can find a good tutorial for doing it manually though if you still want to.
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	under THAT hood it's decompressing the .deb file and installing it to the paths that it's told to, kind of like a ZIP file on Windows with paths, but .deb instead
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	phr34ck		I see.
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	run    man dpkg   from the Konsole
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	well, _technically_ not SCSI, but I heard from somewhere that sd* would be that
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	awilcox		oh sorry -- terminal, not konsole :D
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	phr34ck		I seriously need to get used to that man command ... but the b*** gives like 300 lines per command.
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	phr34ck		That's tooooo much *Sighs*
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	these are probably USB storage devices.. are they USB plug-ins?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	auTONYmous	phr34ck	sorry I'm late on this question...I understand you have an ATI X600, right?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	Excuse me?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	phr34ck	ATI	mobility X600, using my laptop.
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	auTONYmous		and you're having probs getting ATI's driver to work?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	are these little usb sticks?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	yes
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	phr34ck		I didn't try yet, all I did is that I downloaded a .rpm file from ati.com and I have no idea how to make it install.
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	then use: lsmod | grep usb
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Oh	okay. The RPM probably won't work for you.
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	auTONYmous	We are more going over manually installing vs installing from apt / learning Linux in generall.
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	usb_storage should be shown as loaded
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	awilcox		So um, what to do for password loops?  as in, when I boot, it asks for the password.  I enter it, it goes black for a second, then asks for it again.  I think it has something to do with the Xorg.conf file but I'm not really sure what could be wrong with it.  this is a new install, just installed today.  before installing I ran hard disk diagnostics, memory tests, everything to make sure that this computer was performing in tip-top shape.
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	what output do you want?
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	it's there
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	auTONYmous		You either need ATI's .run file or you need to use the one in the repos
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	the current driver doesn't support 3D ?
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	phr34ck	yeah	I figured. I was told that I could use ALIEN to convert, but that is not a good thing. Don't know why.

2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U		!alien
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	ubotu		RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	auTONYmous		that enver worked for me either...FYI
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	auTONYmous		never
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	phr34ck	LinAsH	what do you mean ?

2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	phr34ck		Everything is working fine at the moment, but I want a higher resolution. Currently, I can only use 1024x700 something, and that's just unbarable since I have 15.4" wide screen.
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	that means device is not connected..
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	well, there are two devices connected
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	phr34ck		I need at least 1280 in order to get comfortable with the resolution.
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	FYI it's 1024x768, and you're probably wanting 1280x768
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	check dmesg when you unplug and replug the usb stick
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	witless		where do i add ~/bin to my path ?
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	byp		aight

2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	phr34ck		Everything si soo big, and websites are not rendered correctly "Fonts are soo damn small, or soo damn big"
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	awilcox	witless	~/bin  or  /bin ?
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	witless	awilcox	~/bin

2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	phr34ck		so I thought I could update the driver so I can get that resolution ?
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	awilcox	witless	somewhere in your .bashrc IIRC
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	nothing on connect
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	LinAsH		well if you have 3d support with the free driver why bother with the proprietary one ?
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	phr34ck		I was told once to configure something with x.org or something, I did put that resoltuion but it's not coming up
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	balzac		i'm trying to share a directory of my ubuntu machine with my windows machine
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Rageagainstthis		is there a way to find out my ip address from terminal.  Not the ip that is given by the router but from my isp.
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	auTONYmous		modelines could be off...

2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	awilcox		How often can you repeat a question on this channel without being considered a pest?
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	legal_confusion		how about some help with the nvidia drivers and dual monitors, with seperate X servers ? I have successfully installed the nvidia drivers....

2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	auTONYmous		check the log file to see what the motnitor is reporting as supported res, versus what the driver is using
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	phr34ck		what does Fakeroot do? I saw it twice today.
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	use: depmod -a, then modprobe usb_storage
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	awilcox	noldon	check the Ubuntu Wiki, it's a "normal" problem if you can call it that

2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	can you post your /etc/xorg.conf in pastbin.com ?
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	phr34ck	sure	will do.
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	done, but no results still

2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	all I did was run shred on my flash drive, then fdisked it, and then mkdosfs
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	witless	awilcox	bash
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	kitche	awilcox	actually the default in ubuntu is dash

2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	crimsun	kitche	awilcox, the default -system- shell is dash, but the default -user- shell is still bash

2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	awilcox	Jordan_U	Ahhh, sh-3.1 is dash okay got it thanks :)
2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	kitche	Jordan_U	sorry but I consider sh as shell since sh is a shell

2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	a reboot should take care of all this - I just want to know what the problem is so I can avoid it in the future

2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	ubotu		You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- yesterday.  I'll try it again.
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	awilcox	fr500	change the theme of the root user, I'm not sure how but it's doable, wait for someone more knowledgeable
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	elyon		alwilcox - although, isn't that the same as clicking "Reload" in Synaptic?
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	fr500	ok	
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	not sure, I don't use GUI tools for package management

2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	phr34ck		take a look people, and tell me how to edit it so I can use my resolution.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	wheeee!  pink!  Now, what did you do?  and what part is pink?  does it have a pink tint, is one program pink, or the whole thing?
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	okay, I ran that and tried again... still says its uninstallable.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	snowflake		The whole screen is pinkish, please.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	hmm you may have to add multiverse, not sure, do you have multiverse?
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	snowflake		Now, it's not pink but it sometimes turns pinkish.
2007-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	ShayGuy		I have an Ubuntu LiveCD, but I couldn't connect to the internet with it. I'm currently running Windows. I'm on my home wireless network, using my laptop. The wireless router is a D-Link. How do I need to configure Ubuntu?
2007-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	this sounds like a monitor problem...or an IGP problem, but not a Linux problem.
2007-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- I've had that enabled for a while.
2007-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	at line 93 the driver is vesa : it should be radeon

2007-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	no, but you can run tar -xzf filename.tar.gz and it will make a directory, then it will probably have something like ./configure, then make, then make install
2007-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	snowflake	Innomen	I haven't changed my monitor, please.
2007-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	Innomen		it may have happened in xp NOW, hardware fails pretty much at random
2007-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	awilcox	Innomen	do you still HAVE Winxp installed?

2007-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	Innomen		yay!
2007-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	you may need to add more sources, or distupgrade to edgy :-( , but I'm really not sure
2007-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	snowflake		You sure there isn't a program that turns your whole screen pinkish? Strange thing is, it only happens in my account. My brother doesn't get this problem, please.

2007-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	phr34ck	LinAsH	that's what I did, yes.
2007-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	phr34ck		but still I cannot use the resolution: 1280x768
2007-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	awilcox	heh	yeah, but on old kids shows I remember once there was some character that always ended EVERY sentence with "please" it would drive me insane
2007-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	phr34ck		I won't lose this session if I did so ?
2007-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	dom_		can someone help me get my wifi working?

2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	hmm maybe it needs Dapper
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	yeah but that's the price ;)
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	Innomen	snowflake	delet your account and make a new one? i dont know how you would do that it just a general suggestion
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	dom_		is there any way to reset network settings to default?
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	phr34ck	Innomen	I'm using a 15.4" screen (laptop), it's the best resolution.
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	one question: do you have different resolutions for each of the accounts?
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	Innomen	ahhhh	
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	phr34ck	LinAsH	the hell I won't. I'll wait till the updates are finished.

2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	awilcox		Okay I just installed this Kubuntu 6.06LTS installation today.  After getting everything configured correctly I noticed that it had the /tmp and /home mount points mixed up
2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	melon		in the synaptic package manager (or anywhere else) - is it possible to see what programs/resources/stuff that i've personally added? i'd like to go on a cleanup mission w/o actually breaking things that shouldn't be messed with
2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	mmmm thank you!

2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	phr34ck	snowflake	it's probably your monitor.

2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	kitche		awlicox: ok edit your /etc/fstab with sudo gedit /etc/fstab and flip them around
2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	LinAsH	phr34ck	btw I believe the best resolution for 15"4 is 1280x800 not 1280x768
2007-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	Innomen		i agree, its the moniter
2007-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	phr34ck	LinAsH	I'm not sure if it's supported, but will try it ...... when I log out =)
2007-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	Innomen		Ph34ck: yea, DUH, god

2007-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	ubotu		LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
2007-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	phr34ck		instead of the usual user@machine ~: .. I could customise something of my own.

2007-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	Okay I just installed this Kubuntu 6.06LTS installation today.  After getting everything configured correctly I noticed that it had the /tmp and /home mount points mixed up
2007-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	ok pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	superkirbyartist	I'm not even quite sure what AIGLX /is/, so don't ask me. :)
2007-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Anyone into AIGLX?
2007-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Gonna have to reboot to load the LiveCD...
2007-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	awilcox		so I cp -r'd the home directory to the new mount point, for some reason it didn't even mount /dev/hda8 to /tmp so I didn't have to erase anything, I just formatted it and reset it.  well I put two 8s into fstab so it came up in maintenance mode saying fstab is broke.  so I fixed it.  then it said bad FS type, I forgot to put ext3, so I reformatted and recopied EVERYTHING again
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	ShayGuy		"iwlist scan," you say?
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	awilcox		then I was finally able to almost log in; I typed my password in, then it said "could not run ksomething; check your installation" and then I tried doing it again after resetting the permissions.  it went black, then it went back to the password prompt, then I typed again, then it went back to the prompt after going black for a second
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	auTONYmous	superkirbyartist	It depends if you have an ATI or Nvidia card...
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	phr34ck		what's the best download manager out there?
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	auTONYmous	ATI	= no AIGLX support. Nvidia means you can
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	auTONYmous	Nvidia.  Drivers are installed.
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	awilcox		When I did sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop and then startx from the command line, Xorg caught sig11
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	awilcox	^	Asc, there ya go!
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	What's the output of "ls -ld ~ /tmp" ?
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	Asc		shayguy: I usually recommend running IRC on a computer you're not trying to install in.
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	auTONYmous		check the Beryl wiki...
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	NkuMike		Also is there anyway to vpn to an ubuntu box so that I can play with ubuntu which will be installed on a headless box?
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Okay, give me a minute to read through that
2007-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	auTONYmous	How do I load the AIGLX instead of XGL.
2007-01-01T02:04:00.000Z	auTONYmous		http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Troubleshooting_AIGLX
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Unfortunately, I don't exactly have access to two computers.
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	kitche	superkirbyartist	using AIGLX is easy just don't use XGL uninstall it or whatever you want open a terminal and type in beryl-manager you can make a script that starts beryl on login also
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	http://pastebin.com/848748
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	auTONYmous	NkuMike	Do an Ubuntu Server install (no Xorg), set up SSH-server
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	ShayGuy		My family would not be happy with me monopolizing one of the desktops in addition to my laptop.
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	phr34ck		I'm going to sleep fellas, thanks for the help everyone. Good night.
2007-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	ah you pasted on the slow pastebin site :( thats ok though
2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	NkuMike	auTONYmous	do you know is there a way I can install it on the headless machine from my windows desktop over the LAN?
2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	sorry <:] 
2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	ok your using the i810 drivers for a i915 that's probably your problem might want to install the official intel drivers
2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	auTONYmous	I don't know how to load AIGLX.
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	eob84	Hi	can anyone in here give me any tips on setting up mythtv for an external channel change script?
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	AidanL	Hi	I was wondering if someone could help me with a problem with the installation of Ubuntu...
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	auTONYmous	NkuMike	There is, which requires network booting and mounting an ISO, I've seen it written up, but you'll have to search the Ubuntu WIKI for it
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	maul555		the resolution manager doesnt give me an option to use a resolution bigger than 1024x768..  I know my vidcard and monitor are capable of more, how can i increase the resolution?
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	are you sure? where can i download this? will it mess up my widescreen resolution? (it give some headaches till i get it working...)
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		autonymous I don't know what to do to load AIGLX.
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	auTONYmous	superkirbyartist	It's enabled by default, but you need to remove all your XGL references
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	let me see if I've got this straight.  Your mount points are now okay, but something crashed and now the display doesn't work?
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	auTONYmous	How do you do that?  If I do that, will I see "AIGLX" in my "Sessions" list?
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	arrenlex	Asc	I believe you're talking to awilcox
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	Asc	arrenlex	yeah, probably
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	let me see if I've got this straight.  Your mount points are now okay, but something crashed and now the display doesn't work?
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kitche	superkirbyartist	AIGLX is part of Xorg so you won't see anything in sessions
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	and (k)ubuntu doesn't have a driver for i915? Cause i fresh installed it, so it't the driver that came with kubuntu
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	kitche	how do I use/load it?
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	auTONYmous	superkirbyartist	Nope. You'll just get a standard session. The only way to know is if Beryl Works.
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	maul555		the resolution manager doesnt give me an option to use a resolution bigger than 1024x768..  I know my vidcard and monitor are capable of more, how can i increase the resolution?
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kitche	superkirbyartist	if you use plain xorg your using AIGLX probably have to see your xorg.0.log to make sure
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	AidanL		I am having a problem with the installation of Ubuntu 6.10. I downloaded the Alternate download after problems with the normal download. The problem I am having is that it is failing when installing - Select and install software
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	Angelus		hi guys :) Are you able to load hotmail with thunderbird?
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	auTONYmous	superkirbyartist	AIGLX is built into Xorg. XGL is the only one run as a separate session (basically a secondary X server running atop the primary)
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	eob84		Anyone here ever configure a myth tv channel change script?
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	something like that
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Kitche	and Autonymous: How do I make it start?  Because whenever I load any session beryl crashes!
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	auTONYmous		then you're not getting AIGLX
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	AidanL		Anyones thoughts on my problem would be much appriciated.
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	console mode works (e.g. I'm on irssi right now) but in graphics mode it just goes black and then back to the KDM login promprt
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	auTONYmous		Start by troubleshooting your Nvidia drivers

2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Okay.  Do remember if the ksomething that crashed was more like 'kdesktop' or like 'kthread'?

2007-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	awilcox		the / mountpoint, /dev/hda1, contains the /tmp folder
2007-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	eob84		has anyone here setup and IR blaster for mythtv?
2007-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	So you do have a /tmp.
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	awilcox	arrenlex	yes, just not a separate partition
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	So tell me what that command prints.
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	awilcox		ls -ld ~ /tmp right?
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	awilcox	Yes.
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	yeah but those are open source drivers from Xorg not from Intel

2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	Shocka311		Can anyone tell me how to add and edit partitions on my exesting master hard drive?
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	They are one in the same, I'm pretty sure. Intel released GPL drivers which the Linux developers integrated into their trees.
2007-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	auTONYmous		either (I'm just paranoid)

2007-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	maybe but the xorg driver isn't the intel driver since xorg 7.1 was out before Intel released the drivers

2007-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	see if you have xserver-xorg-video-Intel installed
2007-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	derFlo		can anybody tellme a link to download free games for ScummVM?
2007-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	awilcox	arrenlex	not a bother
2007-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	nevermind let me do some searching
2007-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	okay /dev/hda7 was /home, that should have been /tmp but I didn't set up the mount point during install, and I put /home there by accident
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	auTONYmous		have you switched it?
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	derFlo		can anybody tellme a link to download free games for ScummVM?

2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	asc, arrenlex: so what I did was I formatted /dev/hda8 with mke2fs -j then mounted /dev/hda8 (which SHOULD have been /home) to /home2, then cp -r'd /home/jwilcox /home2, then umounted /dev/hda7, then umounted /dev/hda8 and remounted to /home, then changed /etc/fstab
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	auTONYmous	awilcox	what's the intended mount point for /home?
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	I have xserver-xorg-driver-i810, that one I sent the description
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	/dev/hda8 which is mounted as /home
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	in the description also says: This package provides the driver for the Intel i8xx and i9xx family of chipsets, including i810, i815, i830, i845, i855, i865, i915, and i945 series chips.

2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	also says: X.Org X server -- Intel i8xx, i9xx display driver
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Just a point of curiosity.  /etc/fstab is using /dev/*s instead of UUIDs?
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	marelo		("Intel")
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	auTONYmous	asc	you beat me to it
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	kitche	marlo	try the xserver-xorg-video-Intel then I know on Intel's website they have the linux drivers for download
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	Asc	Oh	right, you mentioned you're using 6.06
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	AidanL		What happens if a section of the install fails i.e. Select and Install Software?
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	Shocka311		anybody? i need to create a new partition on my master hard drive so thatI can install the start up files to install windows on my slave HD but it won't let me edit or create new partitions.
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	Asc		Although I've not used Kubuntu
2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	alex_		I'm kinda mesmerized by aiglx/beryl
2007-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	hmm seems like the driver from Intel is part of Xorg already
2007-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	yeah
2007-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	sigh.... what do i do, then?
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	change your xorg.conf the driver part of i915 see if that helps any
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	awilcox		All I did was change the hda7 to hda8
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	awilcox		that's IT.
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	blackhawk08	hey	i just installed ubuntu today, and i have 2 prblms(expected with linux) prblm 1 is i cant figure out how to give users root permissions and prblm 2 is i cant figure out how to access my files on my slave drive storage partition
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	veryl		how do i stop ubuntu from wanting to update a package?
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	awilcox		EVERYTHING ELSE stayed the same
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	marelo		instead i810 edit to i915??
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	arrenlex		!root | blackhawk08
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	ubotu	blackhawk08	sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Do a 'ps -e | more' and make sure that nothing KDE related is still running
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	marelo	kitche	instead i810 edit to i915??
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	noodles12		what was that program that allowed windows to read ext3 partitions?
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	arrenlex		!mount | blackhawk08
2007-01-01T02:24:00.000Z	ubotu	blackhawk08	Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted (also "man mkfs" for formatting) - Mounting partitions in Gnome under Dapper: System -> Administration -> Disks - For Edgy, see !fstab and !DiskMounter

2007-01-01T02:25:00.000Z	awilcox		Should I kill kthread?
2007-01-01T02:25:00.000Z	dom_		can anyone help me with my wifi?
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	auTONYmous	noodles12	ext2fsd for Windows....it's a driver+program
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	blackhawk08		well i use sudo for root things, but for installing i need root permissions..and for some reason my main account wont let me make directories
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	pickles_		i was having trouble with my laptop wifi, but suse worked much better than ubuntu
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	no
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	kitche	marelo	yeah since I know i915 drivers can do direct rendering glxinfo should have told you if it was using direct rendering or not
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	awilcox		(4) kjournald, khubd, khpsbpkt, klogd, krfcommd
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	dom_		my computer connects to the router, get's an IP from dhcp, but nothing can get through
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	awilcox		two kdm and one kdm_greet
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	dom_		can _anyone_ help me?
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	With the small-numbered processeds, k stand for kernel instead of KDE
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	auTONYmous	awilcox	can you reboot in single user mode:
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	Shocka311		does nobody know??? aaaarrrgghh
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	oh oops :P
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	yes but do what
2007-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	Asc		You probably don't want to try to kill the kernel
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Asc		although it WOULD be interesting
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	awilcox		I assume you mean maintenance mode
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	hahahahahahahahahaha
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	AidanL		I have installed Ubuntu however when I go onto it I have text only and have been asked to login. I don't understand what to do. I thought it booted up, you entered your username and password then got onto your desktop...
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	kitche	Asc	even if you try to kill kthread it restarts back up
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	awilcox	AidanL	my laptop does that, type your name/password then type "startx" at the command prompt
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	AidanL	Ideally, yes. You have a problem.
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	kill the KDMs and KDM_greet, for starters
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	awilcox	AidanL	I have no clue why, it just does that, it's very stupid
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	shall I /etc/init.d/kdm stop first?
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	AidanL	Was there anything odd about your install?
2007-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	AidanL	Do you have the gdm package installed?
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	AidanL		Thanks awilcox, however it has told me there is a Fatal Error:(
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	auTONYmous	awilcox	On startup, pick the "Recovery Mode" kernel from the Grub list
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	alex_		might have gotten the server install =P
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	yes I know HOW, I just don't know WHY...what do I DO with it?
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	Shocka311	kitche	you usually have all the answers, can you help?
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	arrenlex	AidanL	Ah, then you have a big problem. Can you be more specific than "a fatal error"?
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	mine did that also but after a few reboots it worked normally for some reason
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	It's worth a try.  I have no experience with init.d/kdm
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	dom_		i can't even ping localhost.... someone please help me!
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	okay
2007-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	arrenlex	kitche	...o__O
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	ewook		wooooha, happy new years -02:29
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	okay after doing /etc/init.d/kdm stop all of them went away
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	Asc		awilxox: I guess it probably works pretty much the same way as init.d/gdm, but who knows.
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	AidanL	X10	fatal IO error 104 (Connection Reset by peer) on X server ":0.0" after 9 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	auTONYmous		you'll be in a user mode lower than X, which will help verify that the mount points are all okay. Once you exit, it will continue with multi-user mode boot from that point
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	kitche	arrenlex	with just booting to shell first but then after about 3 or so boots it started gdm on boot
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	are you doing startx with sudo or not?
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	kitche	AidanL	ok you probably have to configure X with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	FYI I'm not in X, this is irssi and I'm doing all these commands on tty1 (irssi on tty2)
2007-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	yes it works like gdm
2007-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	no sudo, I don't on my laptop so I am not here
2007-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	should I sudo?
2007-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	hmm.
2007-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	awilcox		it's an NVIDIA GeForce 6100 IGP on an nFORCE 4 (IIRC?) chipset
2007-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	auTONYmous		I figured that, but you're still in runlevel 5...multi-user with X.
2007-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	On my install (which started as 5.04 and I've abused a whole lot) startx stopped working.
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	kitche	auTONYmous	he's in runlevel 2 debian/ubuntu uses runlevel 2 for everything
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Just for fun, try starting with 'sudo kdm'
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	awilcox	auTONYmous	will that REALLY make a difference with /etc/fstab though?!
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	auTONYmous		not yet, but I
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	awilcox	kitche	thank you :)
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	melon		in the synaptic package manager (or anywhere else) - is it possible to see what programs/resources/stuff that i've personally added? i'd like to go on a cleanup mission w/o actually breaking things that shouldn't be messed with
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	okay and okay
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	auTONYmous		sorry...thinking another system again (I get Sun/HP/Linux/others mixed sometimes...)
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	sudo startx did same thing
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	arrenlex	melon	Sort by the first column. Packages that didn't come from the repositories won't have the ubuntu logo.
2007-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	awilcox		Fatal server error:
2007-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	awilcox		Caught signal 11.  Server aborting
2007-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	Asc		0_o
2007-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	melon	Second column, sorry. The one with logos.
2007-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	what, should X not SIGSEG?  (IIRC that's #11)
2007-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	melon		neat.. thanks..
2007-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	AidanL		I have done what you said awilcox but it still does the same. Perhaps I didn't reconfigure it correctly...
2007-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	which explains why KDM keeps rebooting, X is crashing so it automatically restarts X
2007-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	That is displayed when you try to sudo startx/kdm in the tty?  Not when trying to log in?
2007-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	correct, sudo startx OR just regular ol startx
2007-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	Shocka311		if nobody knows does anyone know a support chanell that someone could help me edit and create partitions?
2007-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Sounds like it.  Um, hmm.
2007-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	will_I_am		!skype

2007-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	Asc	X11	is crashing
2007-01-01T02:35:00.000Z	Asc		I suppose you've tried restarting?
2007-01-01T02:35:00.000Z	Pickles		I was thinking about setting up a ubuntu fileserver, but the only two options presented in the ubuntu server install were LAMP and DNS. any recomendations?
2007-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	emacla		How do i remove a directory from a USB-memory stick trought the Terminal?
2007-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	kitche	Pickles	install LAMP if you wish then install Samba

2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	dpk-reconfigure xserver-xorg would have specified a driver, do you remember what it was?
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	AidanL		No I shall do it again
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	any other computers on that router?
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	dom_		my lappy (this one)
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	yep something interesting
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	dom_		also connected wirelessly
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	at a guess it is probably guessing the wrong one
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	awilcox		.xsession-errors was basically empty, only one line
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	awilcox		but /var/log/daemon.log
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	dom_		+ dhcp
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	awilcox		oh BOY daemon.log:
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	AidanL		It picked it up as an x800
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	did you lock down the router config? (I.E. MAC filtering or something?)
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	Dec 31 20:38:19 localhost kdm_greet[4894] : Can't open default user face

2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	dom_	yes	of course, but the mac address is whitelisted

2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous		okay...
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	AidanL		If I can access it...
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	awilcox		oops
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	what driver is reconfigure suggesting?
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	awilcox		actually the timestap for that last one should be 20:39:47
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	awilcox		then
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	ozzloy		my system says there are updates, but the packages can't be authenticated.  how do troubleshoot getting the keys for the packages???
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	awilcox		Dec 31 20:39:48 localhost kdm[4817] : X server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	Asc		I'm gonna go with 'hmm'
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	AidanL	Phlosten	One moment
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	awilcox		Dec 31 20:39:51 localhost kdm_greet[4946] : Can't open default user face
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	you mean, you can't help EITHER?!
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	awilcox		Shall I run another MemTest86+?
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	turn off the blacklisting for a minute and see if that helps
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	AidanL		X server driver: the selected one is ATI
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	another thing
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	AidanL		Which it what it is so I press OK
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	not just yet
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	tried it earlier
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous		no luck?
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	Gunnar		Q: Anyone haveing trouble with OpenGL  (nvidia)  error : Couldn't open OpenGL Subsystem ( Game is tremulous ).
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	nope
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous		using WEP or WPA?
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_		WEP
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	it's a 2000MHz processor OCed to 2050MHz (yes only 50MHz more), running at 35 celsius, 94 fahrenheit
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	awilcox		too hot?
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	as a test i would change that to 'vesa'
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous		OHHH....
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	AidanL		Then it identifies it as ATI TECHNOLOGIES, Inc. R423 UK [Radeon x800SE (PCI-E)] 
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i don't think it's a router problem, as i can connect my laptop fine, i can connect my desktop fine in freespire, and right now, i can't even ping 127.0.0.1
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Although it's true to say that I doubt I can help.  I'm so far out of my depth the fish have lanterns on.  But I can thrash around a little more.
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		i started ssh and im trying to test it but when it ask me for a password and i put it it says gracioso@darkthrone:~$ ssh karla@189.174.90.100
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		karla@189.174.90.100's password:
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		Permission denied, please try again.
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	get "Network Manager"...
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	got it
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	I think that should be okay
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		anyone know why ?
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous		.0.6.3?
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous		(version number)
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i've tried configuring w/ the gui, configuring from command line... nothing helps...
2007-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	you are typing the wrong password
2007-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		after 3 times it says Permission denied (publickey,password).
2007-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	AidanL		Pholsten I will select that. For the rest of the reconfigure do I leave it as the default entries?
2007-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	yeah, should be fine to leave defaults
2007-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	pchilds		Is there an unofficial support site for edgy like dapper has?
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	I'm doing a search on that error.  It's returned a few results, so maybe someone more knowledgeable than I has recorded how to fix it
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	is there an advanced support?  a level II?  #ubuntu-reallyhardquestions ?
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	every card should work with vesa, except the performance will suck, but it will confirm whether it is driver or not
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	well, if you're getting and IP assigned, then you're getting past WEP and MAC filtering...
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i created the user with that password
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	...right...
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		i used openssh to do it
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	AidanL		Another Fatal error. Although it did come up with some pixels at the top of the screen then they quickly disappeared.
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	ozzloy	awilcox	there is paid support available from ubuntu
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	cypruser		How do I install a .tar.gz that I downladed?
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	awilcox	ozzloy	oh geez
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	caps-lock?
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Not that I know of.
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	numlock?
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	and nm-applet is showing connected?
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	dont	understand
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	dom_		yup
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	ping your own IP
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	make sure that the capslock is in the same state as when you set the password
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	dom_		can't
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	the password is case sensitive
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	you're using the fglxr driver?
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	AidanL		The fatal error reads: Could not open default font 'fixed' XIO fatal error 104 (connection reset by peer) on X server ":0.0" after 0 resquests (0known processed) with 0 events remaining. xauth: error in locking authority file /home/aidan/.Xauthority
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	no clue
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	and if the num-lock is in a different state, that can also make the typing come out differently than you expect
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	what ubuntu version is this?
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	100% packet loss
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	how to check?
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	try going to the original machine and signing in with the username/password you are trying to use with ssh
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	when i ping localhost -> "ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted"
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	AidanL		6.10 - (Alternate download) as I had major problems with the main normal download.
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Hrrm.  Was there anything on the line in ~.xsession-errors
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	dannydrifffft		I'm trying to install Ubuntu 6.10. I put the cd in, restart the computer, I get the ubuntu loading screen, and once it gets loaded, I just get an orange screen and everything looks a little choppy. I don't even get a screen asking me what to do. Could it just be that my hardware is not compatible?
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	never seen THAT before...
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i tryied it with 2 users i created but dont accept the password when i test ssh it says permission denied and after 3 times it says Permission denied (publickey,password).
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	yes, i am fairly sure your card isnt supported by the included ATI driver
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	AidanL		O
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i know, right? it's insane....
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that's what happens for me when i type the pw wrong.  or maybe the username is wrong?
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	AidanL		I see... Ubuntu 5.1 worked ok. Although that had to be uninstalled as my wireless adaptor wasn't compatible. So... Where do I go from here do you think?
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i'd chalk it up to a hardware issue... except that it works perfectly in freespire
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	are you using some firewalling?
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	dom_		iptables is installed but i have no rules setup
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	other than that i wouldn't know what could cause that behavior
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	sounds like you may want to do some manual tweaking of your xorg.conf file
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	that line just said Xsession started at blah....
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep fglxr
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	Asc	Okay	.
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	awilcox		I just have glx
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	AidanL		How do I access that... I hate to sound thick...
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	I assume you're PLANNING to use it...
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	a bit hard when you dont have a desktop
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	awilcox		NO glxr just glx
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	do you have physical access to the machine you are trying to ssh to?
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	and if i setup eth0 (the hardline) i can ping around and do whatever
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	AidanL	Yeah	it makes sense lol.
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	you have a terminal prompt open?
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	AidanL		Yeah it is on screen now.
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	also, paste the line you are using to try to use to ssh
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	paste it here, that is
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		ssh karla@189.174.90.100
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	stumper...truly
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	ls -lo / | grep /tmp and tell me what the permissions on your /tmp directory are
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	damnit
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i opened it in my own machine and im only testing it
2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	hang on...
2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i even tried deleting /etc/networking/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf in an effort to start fresh
2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	type 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	do you mean you are trying to ssh from one machine to itself?
2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	AidanL		Command not found.
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	yes
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	AidanL		that is what I am getting. I am probably doing something wrong...
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that's not a normal use of ssh, i'll try it here and see what happens
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	tag		when I attempt to run rdesktop, I get "Major opcode of failed request:  78 (X_CreateColormap)"
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	tag		and more
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	ok
2007-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	Crashzor		iedereen een fijne avond
2007-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	ping

2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	it works here
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	try just 'nano'
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	elyon	Well	I'm back with another stupid noob question.  I recently installed the latest ATI video drivers and now my performance in games is 10x worse than it was BEFORE installing them... any ideas?
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	elyon		I know ATI driver support sucks in Linux, but there's got to be some way to make it workable...
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	AidanL	Phlosten	- nano: command not found
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	ok, you dont have nano, its a text editor

2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	AidanL		I see...
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	you shouldn't have to do that
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	entel	AidanL	sudo apt-get install nano
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	which is odd, as it is a default installed package
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	AidanL		It failed on the installing software bit. Perhaps that would explain it... :$

2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that will take care of starting the server for you.  did you install it that way?
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	ah right, that might explain the font error too, it might be missing something
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	and you are connecting, the server is running, otherwise it wouldn't even get to the point of asking for a pw

2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	ls -lo / | grep /tmp came up nothing
2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	elyon		...also, Add/Remove is telling me that my list of available applications is out of date EVERY time I run it... this is new.  I've done apt-get reload but it still tells me this.  Anyone know why?

2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	ubuntu-desktop is a meta package that will instead all the base ubuntu install, so if you are missing something it should fix it up
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	anyways should ls -lo / | grep /tmp come up anything?
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Asc		after that we learned to use clamps if we wanted to set off more than one at the same time
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Phlosten		instead=install
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	AidanL		Yeah it is installing it now. Thanks alot:). Lets hope it works. Fingers crossed:)

2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	awilcox		ls /tmp returns things
2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	AidanL	Phlosten	I will inform once it is done. It is 10% now lol.
2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	calm down, what does Firefox do?
2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	Phlosten	AidanL	haha, its missing a few bits then ;)

2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	jleemc44		where should I start in troubleshooting my problem? The harddrive will not mount
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	you shouldn't have to do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		why?
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	okay
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	AidanL		28% buffer I/O error on devide hda, logic block 723
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- that just does the same thing.

2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	the apt-get install takes care of that.  but that's a side issue, it's not affecting the current problem
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	it gives NO errors on stdio?
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	elyon		stdio?
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	sorry geeky term, the command line
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	paste the entire thing at http://rafb.net/paste
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	AidanL		Although now we have jumped to 33% and going up now :S
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	ah.  Nope... nothing on the command line at all.

2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	imbecile		does anyone ever get a steady download rate on amule?
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- should I try to reinstall it with Synaptic?
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	http://rafb.net/p/XtGFjf68.html
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	imbecile		maybe i'm thinking maybe im firewalled or something
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	sure
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	awilcox		yay!  neighbors went home without catching the Ford on fire!  rejoice!  :P
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	awilcox		anyways back to Ubuntu matters
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	awilcox		how much does Canonical or whoever charge for paid support?
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	starting to run out of ideas, but I've got maybe two left
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	awilcox		and will they refund it if they can't help me
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	awilcox		AND will they not just say "reinstall it" and charge $255 like Micro$loth?
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- nope... does the same thing after reinstalling.
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	i notice you are sshing specifying the name karla, but the command prompt shows your name as gracioso
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Are you trying to use xgl?
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	no
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	try ssh gracioso@189...
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	awilcox		Just regular old peace-loving Xorg with default stuff
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Zancat_Ubuntu		!packages
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	ubotu		You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Asc		brain made out of hurtings
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	awilcox		like I said, I fiddled with Xorg.conf a little, so do you want me to pastebin it?
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	did you leave and now come back with an idea?
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	and use the password for that user
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- are there error logs somewhere that I can look to fix Firefox?
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	also, don't do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start any more
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	not that I'm aware of; except things like /var/log/daemon.log and stuff like that (and tail | dmesg)
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	pm
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		http://rafb.net/p/1PAW9g95.html
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	Asc	elyon	most of the logs are in /var/log
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	Asc		and some in ~/.xsession-errors as well
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	awilcox		will anybody LOOK if I pastebin Xorg.conf?
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	http://rafb.net/p/1PAW9g95.html
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	jleemc44		"pmount hda1" gives the error "device /dev/hda1 is not removable" what is up with that????? A little help please
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	elyon		Why the heck would it just STOP working like that?
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	Asc		I will, not that it'll do me much good
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that is exactly the behavior i get when i type the password incorrectly.  it stops accepting passwords after 3 tries to keep people from trying billions until they get the right one
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	Asc		Although I'd love to know how you're using pastebin from the terminal
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- In System Monitor, it reports that "firefox-bin" is "Sleeping"
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	elyon		Should I try stopping that?
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	jbroome		don't wake it
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	im typing the correct password im just using that user
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	type into terminal: sudo killall -9 firefox-bin
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	well there IS lynx/w3c
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox		but
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox		I will have to type it in manually
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox		this could take a half an hour
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	at the shell type passwd
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox		another thing
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	ozzloy		it will ask for your current password
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	awilcox		if I do sudo Xorg
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	don't try it then
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	^

2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	awilcox		Actually crimsun it says split from zelazny TO irc.fn

2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	godess		help

2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	DarthLappy	brianMan	That's true.  But there has to be some way...

2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	brianMan	DarthLappy	I'm sure it's possible to make the server silently remove people when it's a netsplit and silently rejoin them on merge
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	_TsU_	awilcox	here we are 1/1/2007 and it's 3;27am :)
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	awilcox	_TsU_	well happy new year :)
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	jevangelo		if you join 2 or more servers during a netsplit
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	_TsU_	ty	u 2 :)
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	jevangelo		and they join back together again, does that cause a nick collision?
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	brianMan		Maybe not on a default IRC server, but I'm sure there's some brilliant coders who can modify the Freenode servers to handle it more elegantly :(
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	imbecile		does anyone ever get a steady download rate on amule?
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	brianMan	It's a matter of making your irc client not list splits
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	imbecile		maybe i'm thinking maybe im firewalled or something
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	QwertyM		how do I configure my MPlayer to play avi etc? it says cant render all the time. Totem and Xine btw, run excellent!
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	genericuser	so	what exactly makes netsplit so common? is IRC flawed?
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	I will try XDM now, thanks
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	kitche	DarthLappy	you you can ignore joins which I do
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Everybody else having this problem either has their /tmp permissions set wrong, or is using glx
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	absurdhero	hey	there doesn't seem to be a package with man pages for the standard C library
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	absurdhero		if anyone knows of one, please enlighten me
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	absurdhero	manpages-dev
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	alienseer23	hello	can anybody here help me with azureus?
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	DarthLappy	kitche	I wasn't complaining anyway.  I think brianMan's point is that each client stilll recieves the quit/join data whether they ignore or not.
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	My final guess would be that maybe KDE doesn't know where the /tmp directory is.
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	brianMan	cafuego	As I said to DarthLappy that doesn't keep the data from being sent to your IRC client. The massive ammount of data your client suddenly recieves (whether it shows it or not) can lags some people off, which also happens to be one of the ways bot attacks work
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	awilcox	absurdhero	I believe it is already installed, try man printf
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	absurdhero	no	its not
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	brianMan	Well, not using a sucky client to begin with would help ;-)
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	absurdhero	Yes, it is.
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	absurdhero		thanks cafuego, that worked
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	oic	-)
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	brianMan	cafuego	That's purely a question of individual taste and something we could argue for an eternity which client is the better ;)
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	absurdhero		I would have thought glibc-doc would have included those. Interesting. Well, thanks again
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	awilcox	printf is also a builtin
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	imbecile		anybody know how to maximize amules u/l-d/l rate? I can never get a steady connection
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	awilcox	cafuego_	oh :)
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	QwertyM		Mplayer says this : FATAL: Couldn't initialize video filters (-vf) or video output (-vo)
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	cafuego_	brianMan	Well, coping with data sent to it would be a good start <heh>
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	QwertyM		when I try playing a avi
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	EvilMike		I'm having a weird problem with my mouse, the sensitivity settings are kind of off, since low sensitivity seems to make the mouse pointer move faster, and if acceleration is off, the mouse moves at a painfully slow speed regardless of sensitivity
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	brianMan	cafuego	mIRC handles it very well ;) (well, except for the spam is annoying to watch) other than that I don't complain ;)
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	imbecile	QwertyM	why dont you just use vlc player? it doesnt use codecs and is really reliable
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	ootput		hi guys, i can't seem to make openbox --replace stick b/w sessions
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	QwertyM	imbecile	thats right but am trying to write up some tests between the other video players, so need this one to play :)
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	ootput	atm	neither metacity nor openbox are active
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	ootput		and it's quite hard for me to click into an input field
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	imbecile	QwertyM	ok
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	elyon		QwertM - you could use Automatix2 to automatically setup all your codecs for you (it lets you use any player to view all video formats (even Windows ones)
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	awilcox		!automatix
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	ubotu	automatix	is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Somebody said this about the error messages: "The message relates to KDM's icon view during login but that isn't Ubuntu's default--did you manually edit the configuration files to turn that on?"
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	awilcox	QwertyM	read that ^  as in, DON'T.
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	no
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	jevangelo		what would be the difference of hosting a webserver on ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	I didn't do that
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	elyon	awilcox	- hehe, where was that when this channel suggested it to me? lol
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	elyon		Of course, I haven't had any problems with it at all.
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	awilcox	jevangelo	desktop comes with KDE/GNOME, server is just text-mode
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	hehe
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	QwertyM	elyon	awilcox I have all codecs installed, gstreamer, win32 etc, all players are doing great except this one lol
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	QwertyM		if automatix can fix that I am glad
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	awilcox	Hmm	.
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	jevangelo	so	no standby modes or anything will cause disruption?
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	Have you got any other DTEs or WMs you can try logging in to?
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	no
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	kitche	QwertyM	type in groups in a terminal and see what group your in
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	jevangelo		just loss of hardware resources because of the x guis?
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	awilcox		I'm on nice comfy Cable Internet (7Mbps!  yeah!) so I could download all of them
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	awilcox	Asc	should I?
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	elyon	Well	everyone (especially awilcox), thanks for all your help.  I'm sure I'll be back again as I try to tackle this beast :P
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	QwertyM		can some mplayer user say the settings on Prefrences > Codecs & Demixers ?
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	No, not really.  They might work though, if the problem is with KDE.
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	)  np
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	ozzloy		my system has updates that can't be authenticated, how do i trouble shoot that??
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	elyon		Moving my family from WinXP to Ubuntu has been interesting to say the least.
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	QwertyM	kitche	says "qwerty adm dialout cdrom floppy audio dip video plugdev lpadmin scanner admin"
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	I just did that too
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	jevangelo		anyone know what im talking about?
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	even my Grandma likes Ubuntu more than XP, she is *SICK* of Bill Gates :)
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	kitche		QwertM hmm ok that's correct
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	elyon	lol	
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	jevangelo		any difference in readily available software through synaptic?
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	jevangelo		with both
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	elyon		My mother, who is COMPLETELY computer illiterate ("Where's the power button?") doesn't have a problem with Ubuntu either.
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	hehe
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	awilcox	elyon	well my grandma isn't illiterate, she did programming in DOS
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	EvilMike		What can I do to directly edit mouse sensitivity (the utility that comes with ubuntu isnt really working for me)?
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	genericuser	EvilMike	hit your mouse with a hammer :-P
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	EvilMike		That would be entertaining.

2007-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	awilcox		KDE FTW.
2007-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	how would i go about installing KDE?

2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	awilcox		I hate GNOME, it's too much like Vista+XP+Mac+FVWM in one

2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	ozzloy	kde	and gnome debates are pointless and irrelevent. .. gnome is the best.
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	dmc_		How would i go about installing KDE?
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	KDE the desktop environment? KDE the application suite? Or Kubuntu the Linux distribution?
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	genericuser	dmc_	apt-get install kde
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	awilcox	ozzloy	I fully agree on pointless.  KDE is the best.
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	Asc	Hmm	
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	just the desktop

2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	__mikem	Didn't he just say he didn't want the whole of kubuntu?
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	Asc	awilcox	I'm very short on ideas now.  One of them would be to reinstall.
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	dmc_	__mikem	whats kubuntu diff than ubuntu?

2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	ootput		of course, the 'K' could also stand for 'Kiddy'
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	__mikem		yes
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	ozzloy		i love amarok, kde has that going for it
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	dmc_		wouldnt it be easier to just install the kde package?
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	awilcox	dmc_	Kubuntu means happiness, and Ubuntu means like humanity or something like that

2007-01-01T04:09:00.000Z	san-man		I'm preparing to install Ubuntu on a computer with a SATA II 300 hard drive. I recall that there were compatability problems with SATA hard drives several months ago, but I can't find anything current on this issue. Have the SATA hard drive  compatability problems been resolved?

2007-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Okay, but still not more than a few seconds probably
2007-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		I ctrl+C it it was slow.
2007-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Might be worth checking the spelling. "sudo hdparm /dev/hd* | grep using_dma"
2007-01-01T04:12:00.000Z	|lastExilE|	kirby	what kernel vsn?
2007-01-01T04:12:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		All values equal one.
2007-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	Arigato		how is the load measured?
2007-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	Asc	Yeah	.  My computer's ten times faster, but it took 0.004 seconds of CPU time.
2007-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	|lastExilE|	dont	bother running a grep then. just pipe it into a file and then grep that
2007-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		cat | grep it
2007-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	Asc	Okay	.  I had skippy mp3 on old hardware for a while and dma was the culprit
2007-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		|lastexile| wait
2007-01-01T04:14:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	HAve you tried any other players?
2007-01-01T04:14:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		After running comand still skips.  Asc: I would like a compiled madplay, please.
2007-01-01T04:14:00.000Z	archangelpetro		has anyone here heard of sopcast??  anyone at all?
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		yeah its going to still be the same, we hadnt issued a change to the dma mode yet
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		we wanted to see if it was using dma
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		I'm using dma and still skips with all CPU activity.
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	just for fun, use the console to run mplayer on one of the files
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Where can I get madplay?
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	ShayGuy	Hey	. I'm back, using a second computer.
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Remember me?
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	Innomen		i do
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Could be tricky, we're using different kernels.
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		mplayer?
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		anyone remember that old curses player... cant remember the name of it
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Asc	How do you know?  And where can I get a command line player.
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	I think it should come with a standard install.  'mplayer filename'
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		mp3blaster
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		mplayer is not a command
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	|lastExilE|	kirby	vlc
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	I'm using a kernel compiled for 686, which wouldn't work on your hardware.
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Is one installed already?  Where can I download a small command line player?
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	Do you have spare disk space to play with?
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Not vlc, takes long to download.
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	Asc	like 500mb
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	|lastExilE|	kirby	mp3blaster a great low overhead curses based mp3 player
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		|lastexile| how to obtain it?
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	madplay is in the repositories.  'sudo apt-get install madplay'
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		http://mp3blaster.sourceforge.net/
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Under "network settings," it says "Wireless connection: This network interface is not configured"
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		you'll need to compile ti
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Thank you!  I needed a precompiled apt-get mp3 player!
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	Asc	superkirbyartist	You can also use 'sudo apt-get install mplayer' to get mplayer, but it's a 3.5 MB download.
2007-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		well then apt-get mp3blaster
2007-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		its in the repos
2007-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		It's very tiny madplay!

2007-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		|lastexile| any differences?  Will it hog bandwidth?
2007-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		differences?
2007-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	ShayGuy		So, how /do/ I configure my network interface?
2007-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		No skip with madplay!  Ubuntu rocks!  Even if I move mouse and stuff on my 266mhz laptop, NO SKIP!!!  Thank you!

2007-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	Asc		For me, madplay uses more CPU but less memory
2007-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	ShayGuy		In Windows, it said "connected to default"...
2007-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		to each their own

2007-01-01T04:29:00.000Z	Asc		I remember using a 150 mhz windows machine.  You couldn't play mp3s and do anything interesting at the same time.
2007-01-01T04:29:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		depends on what you used to play it with
2007-01-01T04:29:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		and how much patience you had
2007-01-01T04:29:00.000Z	ozzloy	|lastExilE|	say "hi!" to lauren for me, if you see her igloo from your dogsled during the 3 month winter night time

2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	conic		you can just put the mp3 player on high priority and it will never skip
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		yeah but then X will seem to hang
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	|lastExilE|		particularly if a swap occurs
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	hosiah		Here in Iowa, we didn't get a white Christmas, but it made up for it with snow for New Year's!
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	ShayGuy		So, how about my network connection...?
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Asc	hmm	yeah.  mp3blaster uses about as much as mplayer

2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		anyone ever have any problems with the dvd playback in 6.10?
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	why did you use pci=noacpi ?
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	con-man		how do I kill a process listed in ps -A
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	nelsonuwp	I do, Totem basically won't. mplayer works fine, though.
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	Ryugi		has anyone here ever setup  an ubuntu machine as a gateeway router?
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	Aar0n444		I read about others using it because their machines wouldn't boot. Mine wouldn't either, so I tried it and it then worked.
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	Asc	con-man	kill [process number] 
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	nelsonuwp	cafuego_	i read something saying it should work, but I dont have the libdvd file..or package
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	Asc	con-man	If you want to, you can also use 'kill $(prgrep [process name] ' to find and kill all instances of a process name
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	cafuego_	nelsonuwp	I do, and it will won't work <heh>
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Innomen	one it's spelled DIAbetes, and two I have it so that's not funny :-(
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Asc		with a closing parenthesis though
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	cafuego_	nelsonuwp	Install 'libdvdread3' and then run the script in /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	wouldn't boot meaning it wouldn't detect the hard drive?

2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	deathmas	ok	heres my big prob
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Aar0n444	Okay	I meant once I press Enter to boot the Live CD, it would just go round and round and round
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	deathmas		I just ran nubuntu install and it failed to install grub
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	theflyingfool	Normally it woul dget automounted under /media and listed on the desktop.
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	deathmas		so if i reboot i dont think its gonna work
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	theflyingfool		even if its ntfs?
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	deathmas		anyway I can do it from this live cd running
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	nelsonuwp	cafuego_	is it already therewith ubuntu?
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		or do I need to dl it?
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	cafuego_	nelsonuwp	Not if you doidn't install it. Check with 'dpkg -l libdvdread3'
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	[shroom] 		Is anyone using an x86_64 kernel on an MSI K9N Platinum (non-SLI) motherboard?
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	hmm... not the issue was thinking... if it was your hard drive, i'd suggest using "pci=nomsi" and give it a whirl
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	peacekpr		then you'd get your NIC back
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Can /anyone/ help me with my connection?
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	deathmas		HELP I need to install a boot loader before I reboot
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Aar0n444		Peachkpr, I put in the live CD, I boot into it, then I press F6, then I just add to the end "pci=nomsi"  ?
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	peacekpr		deathmas... did you try to look at how to install GRUB ?
2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	peacekpr		yes

2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	peacekpr	deathmas	googling how to install GRUB is where my expertise on the subject ends
2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	peacekpr		;)
2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	ski-worklap		anyone know how to fix? right clicking the sucka gives no option for renaming it, and gnome's putting it on my desktop whenever i mount so there is no file to change (that i can find)
2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	peacekpr		i'm scared of messing with the bootloader
2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	peacekpr	hehe	
2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	maddash	they both suck.  stick with Xorg though, it comes with Ubuntu

2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	nelsonuwp	put "sudo " in front of it
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	maddash		awoslappy: I'd be happy with a link you can provide
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	cafuego_	nelsonuwp	make sure no other package admin tool is currently running and try again.
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	peacekpr	Aar0n444	and you said you can't get into your BIOS to mess with the power saving options?
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	nelsonuwp	AWOSLappy	i did
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	maddash	well XFree86 is not compatible with a lot of hardware, and Xorg eats memory.
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	Aar0n444		I can get into the BIOS fine
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	AWOSLappy		I can give you no links

2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	kitche	maddash	only thing that xfree86 is wrong is the license that's why xorg was made
2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		coudlnt find the package
2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Can someone help me install criawips please?

2007-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	DigitalNinja	but yes they can, but it's very very sucky because they must install GNOME libs

2007-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	nelsonuwp	AWOSLappy	if not package is found that means I need to go download it?

2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	siv0x		Could anyone help me get sound ingame, i'm using wine to emulate steam to run counter strike source. I dont hear a beep when i use  cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp, #winehq said that i need to get my ALSAs OSS Emulator working, as far as i know it is.. but still no sound
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	fiendskull9	floppyears	you need to get a ethernet hub or switch, and hook them both up, and set up a shared folder with samba on your ubuntu box
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	weswh-		floppy - personally i would just use ssh. but it probably is easy enough with mac
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	robtp	Innomen	errr.... yeah network-manager-gnome
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	fiendskull9	siv0x	ask in #wine
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	robtp	Innomen	and dont add that to your panel, run nm-applet instead
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Innomen		sudo?
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	weswh-		you shouldn't need samba to do linux -> mac
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Innomen		i feel i should tell you its on the other machine
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	siv0x		friendskull9: read my question, i said i already asked.
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	siv0x	does sound work elsewhere? like when using your media player, etc?
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	ski-worklap		anyone know why bash in gnome-terminal ignores my PATH settings in .bash_profile (edgy/i386) ?

2007-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	maddash	con-man	ok. another (perhaps better?) way of doing this is to create a bash alias...
2007-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	con-man	maddash	I did chmod 1777 to it and it works
2007-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	un_operateur	siv0x	you verified alsa-oss is installed?

2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	Innomen		as in things required before it will run?
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Innomen	yeah
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	hassan2a		no Innomen
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	the problem is that you're running kde. it's big. it's bloated. and it chews through memory with ease.
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	Innomen		i see, is there a complete package?
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	Innomen	app	+ required elements?
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Innomen	once you have an internet connection those will all be taken care of by apt-get
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	hassan2a	Innomen	no
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	what's the stats on your laptop?

2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	SurfnKid		/dev/modem or /dev/ttyS0
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	sounds like my thinkpad. yeah, kde is definitely going to slow you down. have you thought about using a replacement wm? xfce? icewm? *box?
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	raef55		don't know where to get it didn't see it
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	robtp	if it won't kill my bandwidth... usually xfce supports both gnome and kde fine.
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	hassan2a	Innomen	what ? you are a rubbish ? okay
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	robtp	so sudo apt-get install...
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	robtp	superkirbyartist	if i had to guess id say it would be less than 30mb but i dont really know
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	i haven't tried that. I will try that. have you got any other ideas. this is a dual boot system. I'm on another OS right now
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	robtp	package name please?
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	asc__		When I run xfce, the menu is blank.  It's been that way since I first installed it.  Any idea how I can get a default menu?
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	ok, go back to the other system, and do an "sudo ifconfig -a"
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	robtp	superkirbyartist	kpresenter
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	see if your network card is being detected by ubuntu
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	no... didn't though of it yet... i think kde is the most beautiful... well, actually i think enlinghtment is more beautiful, but still beta....
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	billstei	hassan2a	I shot off Innomen's legs in the clone wars and had them sewed on, now I am 9 feet tall
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	bruenig	raef55	open up a fresh terminal and copy and paste the following, wget ftp://ftp.130th.net/pub/mirror/opera/linux/910/final/en/i386/shared/opera_9.10-20061214.6-shared-qt_en_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i opera_9.10-20061214.6-shared-qt_en_i386.deb
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	robtp	superkirbyartist	i just used it to open something and the result was *pretty* ugly
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	well, kde and gnome are notorious for bloat.
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	bruenig	raef55	the entire thing after the comma, all on one line
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	hassan2a	billstei	what girl ?
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	raef55		thanks
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	marelo		and i'm running the game alone... nothing else running... i runned on windows xp with 256 mb ram in a 16mb video card... i don't think kde is the problem...
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	k, i'm actually pretty certain it's being detected. i see it in the device manager
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		Good guess, robtp, I'm on dialup, and it takes 100MB roughly.  robtp: criawips or kpresenter?
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	LOQUILLO_	brb	
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	hassan2a	billstei	what are you shot off he ?
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	robtp	superkirbyartist	ouchhhh it probably pulls in all of kdelibs and a good part of kdebase... i was talking about kpresenter
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	hardware acceleration problem? with the graphics card? maybe wine is emulating the graphix card via software. what card do you have?

2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	superkirbyartist		bye robtp thank you.
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	the game is linux native too

2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	you can usually config ubuntu to hibernate w/a  script
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	np
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	have you tried running unreal in windows on that same system?
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	jeffbrown		I am puzzled because hibernate appears to work, it just isn't triggered when I close the lid
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	no... here in my laptop i only have linux! =]

2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	sorry, don't know how to continue from here. but I think it has to do with the way wine utilizes the graphic capabilities of your video card

2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	ubotu	Sorry	I don't know anything about control - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	con-man		!sound
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	ubotu		If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	lovloss		live = install
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	jeffbrown	ddwagnz	the cd I downloaded was both a live cd and an install cd

2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	ddwagnz		yesss!!!
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	robtp	siv0x	don't you need another argument to ln, or does it create one on . by default?
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	sorry about the delay. there's supposed to be sh file.
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	rchf		Hi I am a Ubuntu seeker of knowledge - any advice on fixing video resolution (I have done what is in FixVideoResolutionHowTo)??
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	there are a bunch of them
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	siv0x	robtp	i wouldnt know, thats why i'm asking : )
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	do "sudo gedit /etc/acpi/actions/lid.sh"
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	marelo		i've just installed unreal tournament in my laptop (running kubuntu) but the game is too slow... what could the problem be?
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	done
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	when you close the lid, the linux kernel will execute the contents of that script
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	Innomen		how do i get back to the gui?
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	lovloss		#kubuntu is dead. anyone here know why i cant get into kdm (which i guess is isnt too far off from gdm) when i have my nvidia dfriver selected? :<
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	ok... I will experiment with that a bit and see what I can figure out
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	so i assume you want to hibernate when lid is closed. ergo, type in "hibernate" command into the lid.sh.
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	billstei	Innomen	Ctrl-Alt-F7
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	marelo		i've just installed unreal tournament in my laptop but the game is too slow... what could the problem be?
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	robtp	siv0x	try ln -s (that dir name) ./steam.exe
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	do you know what files are manipulated when I click the button in power management UI?
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	Innomen		thanky
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	huh ? what management ui?
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	siv0x	robtp	k i'll try, sec.
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	System -> Preferences -> Power Management
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	clouseau_		I've installed 6.06 server on Parallels, and done sudo apt-get install apache2
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	cypruser		Has anyone here ever successfully installed Windows XP on VMware?
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	clouseau_		any idea how to actually start apache?
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	Innomen		so i now have an "about gnome" button, where is the rest of it heheh
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	nelsonuwp		anyone have any idea what a primary nameserver is?
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	sorry, can't help you there. I didn't do a standard install of ubuntu. and I don't have gnome
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	thanks
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	some systems is httpd start, some others is apache start
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	anytime
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	robtp		suspend!! it works fine!!
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	maddash	grasshopper	. lol.
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	or still apache2 start, but you have to pay atetion to the path...
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Innomen		rebooting to kil time heheh
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	cypruser	nelsonuwp	I think a nameserver is a server that translates domain names to IP addresses.
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Innomen		i
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	siv0x	robtp	okay, you are right, but i mistaken, i needed to do ln -s <diff dir> ./steam.exe how do i delete that ln -s ? so i can add the other one instead?
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	robtp		Can anyone tell me what the difference between suspend and hibernate is?
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	Innomen		i'll be around bbl thanks guys :)
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	nelsonuwp	cypruser	any idea how I can figure out what mine is?
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	clouseau__		and apache2ctl start returns apache2ctl: line 88: /usr/sbin/apache2: No such file or directory
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	robtp		you can just remove the steam.exe, all that file is is a link
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	cypruser	nelsonuwp	I think you can use any ISP's name server.
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	I got this message- "ifup: interface eth0 already configured"
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	robtp	siv0x	or you can make a new one using ln -sf, it will overwrite the old one (f being force)
2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	jbroome	cypruser	you can, but it's not good netiquete.
2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	jbroome	nelsonuwp	look at opendns.org
2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	so were you able to connect? I assume that eth0 corresponds to your network card.
2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	first you need to know where the apache2 binary is located
2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	siv0x	robtp	i need it to be drive_c instead of wine: could not load L"Z:\\home\\siv0x\\Steam.exe": Module not found : (
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	rchf		anyone install Ubuntu on an Inspiron 9400?  I've got a video resolution problem?
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	marelo		i don't think it's in the sbin.... but i might be wrong
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	whopper	hi	i just installed the livecd for 6.06.1...it says the current release for firefox is 1.5.0.8, how do i fix this? (sorry im rather new to this :P)
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	robtp	siv0x	i might not be the one to ask
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	n1gke	rchf	I didn't, but what is the trouble ?
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	marelo		after that you can just /patch/to/apache2/apache2 start
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	robtp		can anyone tell me how suspend differs from hibernate?
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	maddash	robtp	google. my friend.
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	eth0 is my network card.  but on the ASUS P5B Deluxe, there are TWO onboard ethernet jacks, only one is showing up. I was not able to connect
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	marelo		or put /path/to/apache2/ in your system PATH and just call apache2 start
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	clouseau__	marelo	normally I'd do "which apache2" to find it, but that returns nothing
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	robtp	maddash	ive been googling, but its still not exactly clear
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	2 jacks? for 2 seperate cards?
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	robtp	maddash	hibernate is a form of suspend? i guess?
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	cypruser	robtp	Suspend does not turn off the computer. It just puts it in a low-power mode.
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	robtp	cypruser	and hibernate uses no power, ok thanks
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	that's because your system don't know where it is, but that doesn't means it isn't there ;)
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	marelo		i've just installed unreal tournament in my laptop (running kubuntu) but the game is too slow... what could the problem be?
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	rchf	n1gke	I have installed and the resolution only come up at 1048x768.  I have followed the FAQ and altered xorg.conf to even eliminate that option and the darn screen and the options and the gui remain in 1048x768.  I'm stuck.
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	if you have 2 cards, then does eth0 correspond to the right one?
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	try finding trough konqueror (or similar) I think is easier than LSing in shell
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	maddash	robtp	http://www.experts-exchange.com/Operating_Systems/Q_21677914.html
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	good point.  I hadn't thought about switching the cable.
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	clouseau__	marelo	I only have a shell. How do I install the desktop environment?
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	maddash	robtp	http://www.experts-exchange.com/Operating_Systems/Q_21677914.html#15568488
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	maddash	clouseau__	
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	no need than. i would just be easier...
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	but I don't understand why only one of them show up.
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	maddash	clouseau__	sudo aptitude install x-window-system-core
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	maddash	clouseau__	then after that, issue "sudo aptitude install xubuntu-desktop"
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	marelo		clo
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	try find / -iname 'apache2'
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	marelo	clouseau_	sudo find...........
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	not sure I comprehend. you're telling me that "sudo ifconfig -a" doesn't show the proper network card?
2007-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	I assume you did a standard ubuntu install via an install cd. during the installation, did the installer detect both cards?
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	i forgot to try that. the only thing i tried was "sudo ifup **"
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	good god.
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	robtp	cypruser	how much/little is the power consumption in suspended state?
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	the install said nothing of network cards
2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	the install should've attempted to detect network interfaces. all of them. wireless/wired/modem/whatever.
2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	cypruser	robtp	I suppose it depends on your computer.
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	if you didn't do "sudo ifconfig -a" , then how do you know what to put for "sudo ifup **"???
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	hagabaka		where is the default library path defined? no LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	cafuego_	hagabaka	in the ld-linux
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	i looked it up in device manager, actually
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	kenthomson		Happy New Year!!! :)
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	and i remember from earlier ubuntu installations, that the install would look for network interfaces, but i did not notice it this time.
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	maddash		oh crap - gotta chk nbc 4
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	Rprp`	Hmm	how vcan i install a .bin file?
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	elyon	Hello	everyone.  Here again asking for help with my Radeon performance.  I installed the latest Linux x86 drivers from ATI but my performance is terrible.  I ran glxinfo and it reported that my Direct Rendering is off.
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	again, do a "sudo ifconfig -a". that's all I have to say.
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	kenthomson		!ati | elyon
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	ubotu	elyon	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	okay, thanks for your help
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	elyon		Also reports my OpenGL vendor is Mesa something or other...
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	kenthomson	elyon	please follow the instruction over there and you should be fine
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	STV0726		I have a problem when trying to load UBUNTU
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	elyon	kenthomson	- I followed that guide yesterday and it screwed things up badly.
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	marelo		i've just installed unreal tournament in my laptop (running kubuntu) but the game is too slow... what could the problem be?
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	kenthomson	elyon	really? what happened?
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	elyon	kenthomson	- more specifically, whenever I logged off, the screen would get garbled and the system locked up.
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	Angelus		hey eveyone! :)
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	elyon		Installing the ATI drivers fixed that.
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	Rprp`	Hmm	how vcan i install a .bin file?
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	maddash		rprp`: just run it
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	Angelus		what wondering if thunderbird could connect with hotmail?
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	maddash		rprp`: if you want, you could copy it over to /usr/bin
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	Rprp`		oke
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	Rprp`	ty	
2007-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	kenthomson	Rprp`	Open a terminal navigate to the folder where the .bin is, and then type "sh <name_file.bin>
2007-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	maddash	kenthomson	rprp`: good god. no way. .bin is not the same as .sh
2007-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	maddash		god
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Rprp`		But it works
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Rprp`		:x

2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Dewi		does the default 6.10 kernel support LVM?
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Angelus		is there an e-mail program that does?
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Dewi		I installed the lvm2 tools package, but pvcreate keeps saying to me: "No program "pvcreate" found for your current version of LVM"
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	h3xis	Angelus	no. hotmail does not allow it anymore
2007-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	Angelus		oh ok, it does with outlook in windows
2007-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	h3xis	Angelus	because it's built in
2007-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	Angelus		cool thanks
2007-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	elyon	Hello	everyone.  Here again asking for help with my Radeon performance.  I installed the latest Linux x86 drivers from ATI but my performance is terrible.  I ran glxinfo and it reported that my Direct Rendering is off.
2007-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	elyon		Also reports my OpenGL vendor is Mesa something or other...
2007-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	elyon		I have already followed the instruction in the Ati Binary HowTo... no luck.
2007-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	maddash		!time

2007-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	rchf	elyon	you got more of a response that I did.  Video problems may be to individual for the forum?
2007-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	maddash		no geez
2007-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	maddash		i want the official time
2007-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	rchf		I have a similar problem but not as bad.

2007-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	ubotu		To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2007-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	elyon	rchf	- its strange because everyone I talk to hasn't had any problems with 3D performance, but I have on EVERY distro I've tried.
2007-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	maddash	ergo	hardware problem
2007-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	rchf	elyon	I was about to start installing the ATI drivers to see how that went.  You saying its a bad course?  I haven't tried 3D much so not much help there - sorry.
2007-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	juanchito2006	elyon	the howto has changed steadily, check it again
2007-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	elyon	rchf	- I wouldn't say it was a bad thing... just hasn't helped.  The how to caused a lot of problems for me, that's all.
2007-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	nnlinux		happy new years
2007-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	maddash		noooooooooooooooooo
2007-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	poningru		happy new year all
2007-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	Dewi		Is it possible to boot a 6.10 live CD with LVM2 support?
2007-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	juanchito2006		HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	maddash		my life! it's all slipping away!
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	elyon		Feliz ano nuevo
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	rchf	elyon	wish the howtos had some "why" in there as well.  I'm using an Inspiron 9400 with an ATI Mobility Radeon x1400 - you?  (happy new year)
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	"sudo ifconfig -a" produced about 3 paragraphs of results.
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	elyon	rchf	- I'm using a Radeon 9600
2007-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	"sudo ifconfig -a > ~/netdat"
2007-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	maddash		then open the file
2007-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	and read at your own pace
2007-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	you have to open "~/netdat"
2007-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	violot		happy new years :)
2007-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	dsock	maddash	k
2007-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	dsock		maddish: thanks again
2007-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	I have Radeon 9200 and I tried to get 3D working and it didn't go well.  Gave up until I get a lot smarter.
2007-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	maddash	dsock	np. that's a lot of network interfaces, btw.
2007-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	elyon		Permission denied when trying to open xorg.conf?  I'm in super user mode
2007-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	juanchito2006	elyon	try sudo chown (user) (directory)
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	elyon	juanchito2006	- I just used file browser to open it ;)
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	rchf	elyon	did you you try to run through the guidance in the FixVideoResolutionHowTo (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto)?
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	elyon	juanchito2006	- I'll try the HowTo again, but I did it yesterday and it messed things up.
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	un_operateur	elyon	and you have a super-user file-browser?
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	Mike_		hello
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	elyon	un_operateur	- apparently... it didn't say permission denied this time lol
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	I'm not even trying to get 3D working.  Just trying for the full 1440x900 I had under ubuntu before my latest reinstall.  Any ideas?
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	un_operateur		it's going to be an interesting new year seeing what people do :)
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	maddash		does anyone here use popularity-contest?
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	Mike_		I am needing some help with the moint points. I don't want to screw up my windows install
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	greatgazoo		HNY from EST everybody!
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	be specific. what help do you need?
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	i do, well, i have it installed and it does it's thing, can't say i "use" it
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	kenthomson_	Mike_	mount your windows partition as /media/windows and don't click on the format checkbox next to it, and you should be ready
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	maddash		unoperateur: it works in the background?
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	not much of an expert, but I edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf manually and inserted 1600x1200 res that I wanted and I have that now.  It did not auto-detect my monitor correctly
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	god your name is so tedious to the fingers. pop-contest works in the background?
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	yea, as a cronjob or something, everyday when APT looks for updates and so
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	I could say your name is tedious too -- mad<TAB> :d
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	Mike_		I am not sure what mount points to use. /dev/hda1 is windows and /hda5 is free
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	yea, popcon is mostly unobtrusive
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	Mike_		what mount point and partition do I select?
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	my program sucks. no autocomplete. for me, popcon is unobtrusive as the sky until I open synaptic.
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	maddash		MIKE_: are you running the installer or something?
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	how does it interfere? it shouldn't
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	Mike_	yes	. I am using the installer that is in Ubuntu. I just downloaded it
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	Mike_		I am at the section where it says prepare mount points
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	I think I have geek ocd or something. I can't stand having programs I can't use. everytime I see it in synaptic, my fingers act on their own accord and purge it from the disk
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	marelo		i've just installed unreal tournament in my laptop (running kubuntu) but the game is too slow... what could the problem be?
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	elyon	juanchito2006	- what do I do when the HowTo instruction lead me to "Errors were encountered"?
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	thanks, I did that a few times and made sure the resulting xorg.conf doesn't have 1048x768 even in it and yet - there it is still in 1048x768.  Weird.  I also did autodetect and that produced a new and somewhat interesting xorg.conf but no change in video resolution in the display.  Almost like I'm editing the wrong xorg.conf (I checked).
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	so what do you want? how many partitions u got so far?
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	then, my conscience kicks in and i reinstall it
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	Mike_		I just have 2
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	Mike_		one has windows and the other is free
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	so you want to add a third one for ubuntu?
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	ok. I assume windows is ntfs, rah?
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	Mike_		I would like to use the 2nd partition
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	raef55		are there debian pkgs  for kaabase and kaa metadata
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	dmc_		i just did an apt-get for kubuntu...how do i start using KDE?
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	Mike_		yes it is ntfs
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	popcon is purely optional, you dont really need it although the ubuntu-dev teams could do with stats polled from your setup
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	do you know which partition is which based on what the installer shows?
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	I don't think they'd get much from my bare-bones install. haha.
2007-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	maybe it falls back on the VESA driver and ignores the xorg.conf ?  I have no idea, sorry, just ignorant guessing
2007-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	anyway, I think I'll *rationally* get rid of it for once and for all. good riddance.
2007-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	dmc_		i just did an apt-get for kubuntu...how do i start using KDE?
2007-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	neither do they with mine, but i have it anyway, i believe no matter how small your contribution is, it's a contribution nonetheless (to the bigger picture anyway)
2007-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	assuming you do, go to "manually edit partition table," select the partition you want ubuntu to be installed to,
2007-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	Mike_	hda1	is windows hda2 is ext3 and hda 3 is extended
2007-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	and change the mount point to "/"
2007-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	maybe - I'm pretty new to this level of the dungeon.
2007-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	there be radeon dragons
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	what? you're my jiminy cricket conscience now?
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	so mount "/dev/hda3" as "/"
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	dmc_		How do i start KDE?
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	juanchito2006	elyon	?
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	kenthomson	dmc_	at the logic screen go to options and choose a KDE session, and then logic wth your username/password, you will end up in KDE if you have kde-desktop package installed
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	j/k. sudo aptitude install popularity-contest, I guess
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	you aren't kidding.  Lets hope their new owners (AMD), do follow through on hints of opening the source.
2007-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	you could say -- was just justifying why i kepy popcon on my barebones install :)
2007-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	kenthomson	rchf	AMD/ATI are BS, they don't OS their drivers. Use INTEL
2007-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	un_operateur		s/kepy/keep/
2007-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	dmc_		sukenthomson: said the package could not be found
2007-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	dmc_		kde-desktop
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	rchf	kenthomson	yes, but Dell put the part into the laptop and the warranty on their boxes kicks butt.
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	ringo		list
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	i think the radeon issues (for me) began when XFree86 switched to XOrg, but at least I'm actually back running linux now
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	what setup do you have? server install? wm? panel? browser? x.org? xfree86?
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	dmc_	kenthomson	said could not find the package
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	well, yea, if you can afford 188 bytes of install space and 1 minute of cronjob time everyday, why not? install it? :)
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	haha, 'cept w/my poorman's system, it's about 4 min of cron time
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	mine's a xorg/xdm/fluxbox
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	what is the 3D supposed to do, not really 3D right?  Faster polygonal rendering?
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	dmc_		How do you go about installing kde?
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	poorer than my 1ghz/256MB box?
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	amicrawle		i add the lates src for amarok  how i get the update now
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	amicrawle		i did  a sudo update amarok right?
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	i don't actually do any gaming, but my Firefox renders very slow, and I hate that
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	finally. a non-xfce purist. what's your panel? or does flux come w/one already? how do you get your desktop icons? xdm= login screen?
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	un_operateur	amicrawle	sudo aptitude update
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	amicrawle	You got src or packages?
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	amicrawle		i src list
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	there are some firefox tweaks out there.  I tried them and they did wonders.  Should be available as an extension called "fasterfox".
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	amicrawle	what?
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	actually all the 2D window move/redraws are slow
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	elyon		!ati
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	ubotu		To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	I don't use a "panel", fluxbox has a "slit" which you can configure -- I dont use desktop icons, why have them anyway if you are never going to use them -- and yea xdg is the lighter counterpart to gdm
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	I have 3 lines for the mount points and 3 for the partitions
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	amicrawle		i did a  sudo aptitude update
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	un_operateur		s/xdg/xdm/
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	my development sys: 192 ram/501 mhz. haha.
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	Mike_	msg	maddash so the first mount point should be /?
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	elyon		great... now firefox doesn't work anymore
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	for a minute there I actually thought the browser WAS the operating system
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	amicrawle		i just got firefox 3
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	jarrod10	question	since ubuntu is precompiled for i386, wouldnt it not be optimized for newer computers, meaning running it on them will be slower than it could be?
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	xdg? or xdm? I'm confused...
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	that does quite well unless you play the latest version of quake :)
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	my next post s///ed that mistake :)
2007-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	xdm 'twas
2007-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	I can see how that could get old fast.  Can you try avoiding the problem by finding if there is a way to have window moves just be outlines?  Yes - Netscape was right but just to early with the slogan to save itself from M$'s heel.
2007-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	amicrawle	ok	i see there amarok is at 1.44  i'm at  1.3.9
2007-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	amicrawle		how do i get uptodate
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	haha thanks for the info. my new setup's going to run faster than xp, I think.
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	cypher1	amicrawle	sudo apt-get install amarok
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	pengulord		http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-11877293110734541
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	jarrod10	compiling some program for i386 and runnint it on a i[56] 86 does not necessarily make it slower -- but yea, i686 software uses the full potential of an i686 system and performs better than a i386 alternate
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	un_operateur		running them*
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	maddash	Mike_	I'm confused. what do you mean 3 lines?
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	what do you currently use?
2007-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	not sure if window moves can be tweaked, but I'm too stubborn to change it.
2007-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	Mike_		on my screen there is 3 columns, the first is mount point then size then partition
2007-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	unikon		anyone what is the best expense tracker/budget tracker for linux?
2007-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	right now? xp. I'm trying to build a new setup on my thinkpad (which is considerably faster than my dev machine, but gnome bogs it down)...so far, I've got a server setup, x-windows-system-core, openbox/obconf, idesk, and fbpanel. and firefox, but I'm going to purge it in favor of dillo.
2007-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	elyon	Okay	one more question - why does Synaptic and Add/Remove tell me I need to update my lists EVERY time I run them?
2007-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	unikon	gnucash looks decent, but I haven't messed with it much yet
2007-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	maddash	elyon	b/c it's fun. for synaptic.
2007-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	Mike_		under mount point and partition there are 3 places ( sections) that I can change
2007-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	maddash	elyon	you can change that under synaptic preferences, I think
2007-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	maddash	elyon	otherwise use aptitude
2007-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	unikon		gnucash is ok  but id like to check out kbudget http://tinyurl.com/yh6ztt
2007-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	elyon	maddash	- it didn't use to do this, though.  Now it always says the list is out of date...
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	I hope you win  and write it up!
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	maddash		MIKE_: ok, so select "/dev/hda2" and delete the partition.
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	well, that sounds good enough -- kinda similar to mine but I have to use gnome tho (i wish i didnt have to) at times mainly due to Evolution and a few others
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	then you'll have a chunk of free space
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	Mike_		right.. I did that
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	after the format, select the free space and mount it as "/" or whatever. the default option is for ubuntu to use that free chunk as it's residing partition.
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	amicrawle		The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	amicrawle		amarok: Depends: libvisual-0.4-0 (>= 0.4.0) but it is not installable
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	amicrawle	E	Broken packages
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	why not just kick out gnome and do openbox + evol?
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	amicrawle		what does the mean?
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	amicrawle		that
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	amicrawle		mean
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	maddash	amicrawle	isntall libvisual.
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	maddash	amicrawle	install*
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	cypher1	amicrawle	can you please paste the whole thing at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	can you tell me where one gets/finds 'aticonfig'?
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	well, mainly because i can't be asked to do a non-gnome thingy plus it's only evol that's a "pain" (non-issue really)
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	gonna get a new MB with dual core and nvidia, because no computer is truly happy until it jumps right off the desk and finishes even before you tell it to begin
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	amicrawle		can't find it in my src pile
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	so you have 2 sep sessions? for gnome and flux?
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	I got enough memory to spare that's doing nothing, I can afford to let Evolution be greedy
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	hah. nice.
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	sounds like something we all need.  I just don't want it finishing my sentences for me.
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	no no, just one session -- but I run the gnome-settings-daemon in the background, so some apps have a gnome-ish feel to them
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	amicrawle		<cypher1 just did
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	why not just get a gnome theme for flux?
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	i don't have aticonfig
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	because my theme rocks better :)
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	cypher1	amicrawle	please tell us the URL
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	billstei	rchf	but now that I know that others have it I want it
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	hepme		why does ubuntu come with a /mnt directory if everything is mounted in /media ?
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	amicrawle		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	cypher1	amicrawle	which version of ubuntu are you on
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	amicrawle		dapper
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	rchf	billstei	!  all the FAQs on drivers for ATI keep mentioning it.  Must be obvious but haven't stumbled into it.  thx
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	maddash		huh?
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	cypher1	amicrawle	no the number you get when you submit it
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	amicrawle		want to goto edgy
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	hepme	"cross-compatibility" with software written for other distros i suppose
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	nomasteryoda|w	hepme	because most linux distros use /mnt as a temporary mounting point..
2007-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	nomasteryoda|w		nice

2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	maddash	innomen	uhh.."gui" usually implies that you are running gnome already
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Innomen	ubuntu	alone has a gui
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	h3xis	al	why are you wanting to run firestarter on a ppp connection?

2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Mike_		ok.. I just created a new partition
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	al		hello.. Ubuntu didnt start a firewall by default, isnt it?  how terrible without at least a simple firewall in the world
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Innomen		define "as sudo"
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	h3xis	al	yes, it does

2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	jbroome	al	it doesn't beacuse it doesn't have ports open by default
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Innomen		one moment
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	xtknight		just for reference use gksudo for running gnome programs as super user
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	h3xis	xtknight	why?
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	xtknight		or gksu, same thing i think
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	rye78	h3xis	I could never get any distro looking as nice (in my eyes) as my old fedora box:  http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f239/codvx/Screenshot-1.png

2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	amicrawle	al	why do you want a firewall
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	h3xis	rye78	that theme is bluecurve. just find it and use it :P
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	xtknight		i heard if u ran gnome apps  without gksu theres a rare chance something could get corrupted
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		!firewall | al
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	ubotu	al	Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	amicrawle		or kmyfirewall
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	xtknight		ill have to be honest most of the time i dont even bother with gksu ;)

2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	i thought you said that you only have 3 partitions...
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	do you have something new in your system tray?
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	jbroome		underworld?
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	Innomen		not that i can tell
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	xtknight		anyone here have a JMicron controller on their motherboard?
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	Innomen		ONE MOMENT
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	Innomen		sorry caps
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	and you wanted to install ubuntu to hda2, rah? didn't I tell you before to delete hda2?
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	al		Did you guys mean, on a lonely pc, it is not neccessary to setup a firewall, or its not useful?
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	xtknight		or core 2 duo system and is experiencing freezing?
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	h3xis	al	it's not necessary. it is fine as is
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	amicrawle	al	it's relly not useful
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Mike_		I delted hda2 when you told me to
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	amicrawle		your in the *nix world now
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	al		So you dont have any firewall?
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	amicrawle		people relly don;t mess with your system unlike windows
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	amicrawle	al	
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	amicrawle		no
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	h3xis	al	iptables is a firewall
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		...you still technically have one.
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	xtknight		what's the default iptables config?
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	jbroome		off
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	xtknight		to block all anonymous requests?
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	amicrawle		just my falt on
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	you still should be able to see some trace of the free space...
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	restart the installer. press ctrl+alt+del.
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	al		thank u all^
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	xtknight		i think suse is the only one with a default enabled firewall, maybe fedora.  i dont see a need for it with linux other than for servers, etc
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	amicrawle		did you just move from windows?
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	al		fedora
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	bruenig		!firewall

2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	hepme		does shareware exist in the linux world, or only completely free or completely commercial?
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	al	yes	me
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	amicrawle		ah good ol redhat
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	bruenig	I already directed him to it. Dunno if he read it or not though.
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it's all free
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ubuntu	has iptables enabled too, just without any chains in it and a default ALLOW policy
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Mike_		you want me to restart the whole thing?
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Innomen	brb	
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	hepme	h3xis	i mean from 3rd party people
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	bruenig	hepme	virtually no shareware
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it's still free
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	hepme	well yes but i believe it's against the GNU linux philosophy....take VMware for linux, for example
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	asc__	firestarter	is nice for easy router makeing
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	right
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	hepme		not all software for linux is free though
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	asc__		So in a WAY having a firewall is useful....
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight		i think u'd consider that shareware..i dont know but its not open source is it
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Rookie_		If you stay online alot and on longer periods, then you should have a firewall - but if you only remain in short periods its not necessery to have a firewall
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	vmware	workstation, specifically
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it is all "free"
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	bruenig	hepme	free as in no $
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	hepme		free has two meanings though
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	bruenig	hepme	except a few apps like cedega
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	h3xis		right
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	xtknight		theres free software which means no $, and then there's freedom software by the FSF definition
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	h3xis		it's all free as in you can do whatever you want with the code
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	h3xis		but price is a diff subject
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	no, flash is not free as in code
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	hepme	h3xis	well you're wrong on that count too since there are some linux things that dont come with source code, such as blobs :P
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	well, press "esc" first. get out of the partition manager.
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	bruenig		yeah there are some blobs, but very few
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight		nvidia/ati drivers actually
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	then select "partition hardrive" from the list,
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	h3xis	bruenig	if i wanted i could get the code from adobe
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight		but aren't they including non-free in Feisty by default?  how is that legal?
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	al		Linux is free, but it's not cheap, I nearly cant afford it
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	al		did you agree?
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	then select "manually edit partition table" if it's available...
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		Its free and cheap. >.>
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	no you couldn't
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	unless you have some sort of inside there, like you are a developer or something
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	h3xis	bruenig	you sure? i was told you could a long time ago when macromedia owned it
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	al		I need to buy a CROssOver office to run Photoshop 7
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	hepme		is ubuntu ever going to get rid of the code names, they don't seem to make understanding the versions any easier than using numbers, dates even that makes it more clear
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		They're not going to toss you their code >.>
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	al		and a EIO office
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	xtknight		i think every linux distro has a codename so i doubt they'll get rid of it
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	you can't get it, I am sure, look at things like gnash, if you could just get the code, there would be no gnash
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	hepme	its...very very simple. It progresses with the alphabet. I can't see it being any simpler with numbers, the sequencing idea is simple.
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	amicrawle		The following packages have unmet dependencies:

2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	xtknight		i mean, it makes it easy to refer to stuff.  I can say Sarge, Feisty, Edgy, all the linux people know what im talking aobut, i dont have to say debian 3.1, it's too lengthy to type out every time
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	hepme		how is warty warthog in alphabetical order

2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	xtknight		or use sudo
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	crimsun	hepme	who said it was in alphabetical order?
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		They are now! ;P

2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	al		my most hope, is GIMP will good for hand draw.

2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	hepme		if gimp supports /dev/wacom then it could be good for drawing

2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	hepme		and now everyone is just a little frsutrated. irc is not a word processor :p

2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	xtknight		but to fix your problem...u need a newer  version of the package libvisual that is all
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	amicrawle		how do i get that
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Mike_		I do see the 22 gig of free space
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	asc__	Hey	I'm in a pm with shayguy.  He needs to put a hex key into the configuration thing for a wireless device, and the password field is too short.  It's  13 characters (the hex string is 26), and doesn't translate into a typeable string.
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	aha! great!
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	select the free space
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	xtknight	amicrawle	sorry, actually it looks like you downloaded a non-ubuntu debian package or something..
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	the rest should be intuitive...
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	TheItalianGuy		hey guys, what program would you use to take screen caps with DVD's??????
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	amicrawle		Index of /ubuntu/pool/main/libv/libvisual
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	i did not use the synaptic to install soft
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	amicrawle		i got it from there
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	that message will happen if you have synaptic open, or if you do not prefix the 'apt-get install' command with sudio
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	xtknight		sudo* sorry
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	khaije1	cafuego	- is the lsb stuff new for edgy?
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	hepme		what does lsb stand for
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Mike_		Do I use hda1 as the mount point for partition hda1
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	khaije1	linux	standards base > hepme
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	xtknight		least significant bit? linux standards base? i dont know
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	hepme		/media/hda1
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,yes...maybe i apt-get install something and something to crash
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	Mike_		then use / as the mount point for partition hda5?
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	what are you trying to install and how?   use this to install a package from the terminal: sudo apt-get install package-name
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	yes, don't change the mount points of the partitions you want left untouched
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	khaije1		has anyone had success using ssh for arbitrary tunneling?
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	rye78		WHy can't I su - in terminal in ubuntu?
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	yes
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	rye78		I ahve to type sudo all the damn time
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		!sudo | rye78
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	ubotu	rye78	sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Mike_	ok	
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	rye78		It's annoying
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	xtknight	rye78	su is disabled in ubuntu.  `sudo -H -s` is the equivalent to `su`
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	but i cant remember how to do it off the top of my head :/ been long time
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	vvlaw		just now, i tried to "sudo apt-get install mplayer win32codecs
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	rye78		oh
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	um, why hda5? is that where you want to install ubuntu?
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	h3xis	su	isnt disabled
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	select the free space...
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Mike_		free space is hda5
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	h3xis	rye78	if you want su back type sudo makepasswd and choose a root password and you will be able to use su from then on
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	you are still getting the same error message?
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Innomen		this is not good
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Mike_		hda3 is extended 22 gig free
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Innomen		i still cant start the network manager
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	i haven't been able to figure out what I'm doing wrong, I'm trying to use the -D option for dynamic (socks-style) forward proxy tunneling. In my case it's mostly just to evade corporate content filter
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,yeah...maybe there have something to interrupt

2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	oh i see, so you compiled it to begin with and didn't use the mplayer out of the apt-get repository?
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	Mike_		done.. now I have 22 gig of unalocated space
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,yes.use the command"make && sudo make install"
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	are you on wired or wireless
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	Innomen		assume it is running how do i make it visable?
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	cmweb	khermans	iostat is not in my repositories, it has been doing this at every start up
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	asc__	xtknight	it's made more difficult because I'm trying to walk somebody else through it and I've never set up a wireless network before. :p
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	Innomen		wireless
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	xtknight	asc__	iwconfig eth0 essid SSIDNAME
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	afterwards, if you still see the free space, select it,
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	do you see something that looks like bars like on a cell phone interface?
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	xtknight	asc__	iwconfig eth0 ap any
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	showing a signal strength
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	Innomen		pcmcia linksys which i think it sees, but its too stupid to display avilable networks
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	khermans	cmweb	sudo aptitude install sysstat
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	Innomen		no

2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	Mike_		selected
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,i compiled it after i apt-get install later.
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	choose "/" as your mount point, but don't use up the entire 22gb...leave about 2-3 gb
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	so when you run sudo nm-applet what do you get
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		gah.pm me, i gotta go thanks h3xis :)
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		nothing
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		nothing happens
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	what do you mean
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		i did that before
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	ok, so is mplayer installed right now?  you are trying to install the mplayer from apt-get instead now, correct?
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	h3xis		do you get an error
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	h3xis		or what
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		just that
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen	click	and nothing happens
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	h3xis		o.o
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		yea
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		i would prefer an error
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	with the remaining 2-3gb, mount is as "swap"
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	asc__	xtknight	Okay, thanks
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		anyway
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen		i gone
2007-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	Innomen	sory	/

2007-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	h3xis	Innomen	this is not finished!
2007-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,yes :)
2007-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	alright, so i guess we're back to the beginning...u typed `sudo apt-get install mplayer` and you are getting this error: `E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?`
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		If I have a string like "foo bar baz", what's the most elegant way in bash script to test if "baz" is in that string ? something prettier that "echo $string" | grep -q "baz" - &&
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	sorry, I just realized that you're running the GUI installer, not the text mode version I'm used to
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	zcat[1]	if echo $a | grep baz ; do
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,certainly :)
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	Mike_	Iam	sorry I was not more clear..
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	type this and tell me the output:  ps ax | grep synaptic
2007-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	zcat[1]	Or is that what you want to avoid?
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	does it work?
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	arrenlex	echo | grep is what I wanted to avoid... but I can't see anything better :(
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	Mike_		I am still new to linux installs,,
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	Mike_		I am getting there
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	don't worry about that, everyone had to have been new at some point
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	h3xis	maddash	BS. i was born knowing how to use linux.
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		I guess I should probably write this in python.. but I know bash best. I'm not much of a coder :)
2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	vvlaw@vvlaw-laptop:~/tools/player/MPlayer-1.0rc1$ ps ax | grep synaptic

2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	maddash	h3xis	oh yeah? well let's see how you do w/o my protection, mr. gnu-fanboy.
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	maddash	h3xis	j/k. rofl.
2007-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	h3xis	XD	
2007-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	can you tell me exactly what you are typing that causes that error?
2007-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	khermans	zcat[1]	what r u writing?
2007-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	khermans	postinstall script kinda like easyubuntu, but not using the very unreliable plf repos...
2007-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	maybe i install something by the apt and it crash there.but i forgot what software i install:(
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	type this: sudo apt-get install
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	xtknight		put nothing after 'install'...this will just check your apt-get system
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	khermans	vvlaw	sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	h3xis	damn	vvlaw just log out and log back in or restart haha
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	h3xis		it'll close whatever is using apt-get
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	khermans	zcat[1]	we dont need another one of those scripts
2007-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	khermans	hehe	sorry
2007-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	I think I was wrong. you might have to convert the free space to ext3 before partitioning it...
2007-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	just don't partition the whole thing...leave some for the swap.
2007-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	just do what kherman said...it should fix your problem..we already verified u didn't have synaptic open and you're using sudo so something just went wrong...
2007-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	so essentially, you're splitting the 22gb into 20 gb for "/" and 2 gb for "swap"
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	vvlaw	khermans	yeah...it worked fine...
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		I need one .. easyubuntu doesn't install everything I want and plf is down whenever I want to use it. And automaticx breaks stuff.
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	yes. i fixed :)
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	I am trying to make the 3 gig for swap and it is giving me an error
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	vvlaw		but do i need to remove the mplayer first ?
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	Mike_		says it cant create it
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	vvlaw		mplayer is already the newest version.
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	vvlaw		w32codecs is already the newest version.
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	khermans	zcat[1]	what do you need?
2007-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	no, not really.  but you can do this: sudo dpkg --purge mplayer w32codecs
2007-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	and then do: sudo apt-get install mplayer w32codecs.....after all that it will definitely be what is in the repositories and not what you compiled yourself
2007-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	khermans	vvlaw	save yourself some trouble an use vlc
2007-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	what's wrong?
2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		sensible source-list with universe, multiverse, backports and seveas repos. w32 and stuff, 3d, lotsa games, hydrogen, mednafen, mame, wine..
2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	something got
2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	vvlaw		vvlaw@vvlaw-laptop:~/tools/player/MPlayer-1.0rc1$ sudo dpkg --purge mplayer w32codecs

2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	maddash		for the record, having gparted in the edgy installer is a HUGE mistake. the textmode installer from breezy and dapper were just fine...so developers, if you're out there, take heed.
2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	please use pastebin ( http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org )  just copy the text there and paste the URL it gives you
2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	but only for the next time you have to paste something
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	asc__	xtknight	should 'sudo iwconfig interface [essid]  "[essid] " key [key] ;sudo ifup [interface] ' work, in your estimation?
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	that warning is fine, just install mplayer and w32codecs again
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	khermans	zcat[1]	adding many third-party repos is not revommended
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	hang on a sec
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		I'm adding seveas and wine only..
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	khermans	zcat[1]	thats like a one line script!
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	amicrawler		can any body see me
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	yeah the text installers were great, they were very intuitive I thought, but I guess some couldn't use them
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	asc__	er	interface [interface]  essid "[essid] "
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	xtknight	asc__	it is: 'sudo iwconfig interface essid [essid] '....im not sure what u need to do after that
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	xtknight	amicrawler	yes i can help u, in pm
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	you can always use the alternate isos
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	zcat[1] 		not if you want pretty dialogs and the ability to select what you want...
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	asc__	xtknight	Okay.  Thanks.
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	xtknight	asc__	i would do `sudo ifdown interface`, then `sudo dhclient interface`...u should be good to go
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	I guess...but then I'd have to spend 1.5 hrs dl-ing one iso only to find out that i need another.
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	khermans	zcat[1]	here you go for universe/multiverse -> sudo sed -i 's/main restricted$/main restricted universe multiverse/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	xtknight	asc__	after the ESSID thing that is..and watch the wireless interface log
2007-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	xtknight	asc__	that would be at `iwevent`
2007-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	khermans	and automatically fetch repo keys?
2007-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	no you wouldn't, you would know get the alternate iso
2007-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	well, then again, I'd never dl edgy...no lts.
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	are you on server or something
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	wish me luck..
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	why?
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig		I mean how much support do you need
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	why? you got the swap partition up?
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	Mike_		yes
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig		If they support for 18 months, I am going to stop using edgy in 6 months anyways, so not a big deal
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	Mike_		just hope I have it configured correctly
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	ok. nice going. let me know how it turns out
2007-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	provided that the install doesn't take too long
2007-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	Mike_		the / is 19 gig and going to hda3
2007-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	oh. let me rephrase. "well then again, I'd never dl edgy. i'm caveman."
2007-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	Mike_		the swap is going to hda4
2007-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	Mike_		sounds right
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	did you defrag your ntfs before partitioning?
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	Mike_		no
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	asfalt	hey	is there a gui tool for configuring WPA wifi connections in edgy?
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	ouch. careful.
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	Mike_		it was already partitioned along time ago
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		!wifi | asfalt
2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	ubotu	asfalt	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

2007-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	Mike_		I did not adjust hda1
2007-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	Mike_		installing
2007-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	Mike_		should not take long
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	xtknight		what's the command to show every version of a given package (it shows every version u can get from all the repositories in ur index)?
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	Mike_		it is a 1.8ghz 64 bit laptop
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	asfalt		thank you
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	maddash	xtknight	aptitude?
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	xtknight	maddash	yeah, i dont know the command line for it tho
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	Mike_		as soon as this installs I need to get to bed
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	maddash	xtknight	errr...."sudo aptitude"?
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/87/
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	xtknight	maddash	there is an argument you pass aptitude, but i dont know what it needs to be
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	m4jqp		my friend just installed unbuntu and he says that it didnt ask him to imput an root pass ... how can he find/make a new one? (just installed)
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	something did not reinstall.
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	DBO		!root | m4jqp
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	ubotu	m4jqp	sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,and did not repleace it
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	m4jqp		no quick and dirty?
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	DBO	m4jqp	does he REALLY want a root password?
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	m4jqp		you need it to do almost anything
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	DBO		no you dont
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Not true
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	maddash	m4jqp	sudo passwd
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	DBO		thats what sudo is for
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	m4jqp		well to install stuff you need it
2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	DBO	m4jqp	have him type his password when installing

2007-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	DBO	m4jqp	sudo apt-get install package will prompt for a passowrd
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	it looks like your mplayer fonts are missing
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	m4jqp		said it didnt ask him to imput it
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	maddash	m4jqp	open a cmdline, do "sudo passwd"..."su" can be configured via "sudo su".
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	DBO		he then types his password
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	DBO	maddash	generally we dont advertise that method right away
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	m4jqp	ok	thx
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	i really don't know what to do from there, the fonts should be available online somewhere
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	DBO		we like to teach about sudo first
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	oh ok, that is the exact equivalent of what i'm doing...
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	you did that and it doesnt work?
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	khaije1		did you need to change any sshd settings? ya...
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	maddash	DBO	"we"? KISS.
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	h3xis		nope
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	amicrawler		does any body know how to chat voice dcc ?
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	maddash	DBO	he didn't ask for a lesson.
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	lol.. the font is not important. the xv output and alsa support is aimportant
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	half way thru copying files
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	have you taken into account that your corp has port 22 blocked?
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	DBO	maddash	opening up root directly will present security issues
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	maddash	mike_	ok, gtg pass out. good luck.
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	DBO		later
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	oh, i thought that error was stopping you
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	my mplayer has xv and alsa support and i didnt compile it :/
2007-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	Mike_		Thanks for the help maddash
2007-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,yeap . yester i apt and install it , it has xv and alsa support
2007-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,but from i compiled it , they were gone :(
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	cmweb		!sysstat
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	ubotu		sysstat: sar, iostat and mpstat - system performance tools for Linux. In component universe, is optional. Version 6.1.3-1 (edgy), package size 146 kB, installed size 644 kB
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	it's not that, straight ssh is fine, i can do X-forwarding as well
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	cmweb		How do i use sysstat?
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	hepme		is Synaptic package manager a product of GNOME or is it ubuntu specific? I ask because it allows you to manage repositories but not all linux distros use apt-get like repositories yet can still run GNOME
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	that is very odd..... so `mplayer -vo help` reports no xv when you use the apt-get version of mplayer?
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	cmweb		OK i got the thing installed khermans but what now?
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it was developed for debian
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	hepme		what other s ystems besides debian and ubuntu/kubuntu use debian like packages
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	Rprp`		ChanServ dikkie Rprp Yogho|Bed ZwarteCobra {-_-}
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	maybe .because i want to back of that version
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	cmweb	khermans	now what i got it installed
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	xandros i think
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	sorry, i guess you will have to compile again..  i dont know why xv is not in your version by default though
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	hepme		whats a strong coffee? coffee with mountain dew in it?
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	xtknight		dark french roast
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	Mike_		can you set up Ubuntu so that when you change desktops it looks like you are changing to a different side of a "cube"
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	juanchito2006		Colombian
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	vvlaw		xtknight,do you know the xv support fuction? --enable-xv?
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Mike_	yes, use Beryl or XGL/compiz
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	i don't know, sorry, all i know is XV is enabled for me when I do `sudo apt-get install mplayer`.  ive never had to compile mplayer for XV or alsa support
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	Mike_		is it grapgics card dependant?
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Mike_	very..
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	Mike_		*graphics
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Mike_	you need drivers that do accelerated opengl, i think only intel, nvidia and ati will work with it
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	Mike_		I have an ATI Radeon 200m express
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	it's ok...thanks for your help :)

2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	asc__	python asc() will do one character at a time. Not sure what else will do it
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	Mike_		I am sure it can handle it.. It has 128 megs of ram on it
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	asc__		zcat:okay, that should work
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	cmweb		How is beryl obtained
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	cmweb	just google `ubuntu beryl`
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	xtknight	zcat	isn't that for decimal ASCII, not hex?
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	cmweb		i wish this thing would stop indexing
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	cmweb		is thweir any way to make it stop doing that

2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	xtknight	python will interpret 0xNN correctly though..
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	you are missing a dash/hyphen at the end of your command

2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	do you use edgy , 32-bit or 64-bit?  i might be able to make a package for you
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	though it would be better if we debugged your compile problems
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	cmweb		Its kinda hard for me to getinto paste bin with this thing being like it is
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	xtknight	cmweb	well is there anything in dmesg indicating an index operation?  what about just rebooting? that may fix it as bad as it sounds
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	vvlaw	xtknight	edgy 32bit :)
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	cmweb	xtknight	i reboot once then in five minutes after its all done it does it again
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	xtknight	vvlaw	what is the compile error?

2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	xtknight	cmweb	im afraid i need a dmesg to properly debug it, but maybe u can sneak one in before the 5 mins is up
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	cmweb	ok	its doing better i think i can get it  in

2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	Zyphern	now	does this require internet connectivity to do kd7swh?
2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	adorablepuppy		hrm. . . .I had realized that when I read it 10 seconds ago.

2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	cyraq		does ubuntu 6.10 support dual-screens using an ATI card?
2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	the only way you could install dhcpcd without network con. is by storing to deb (install) file on another cd or something
2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	kd7swh		the deb*
2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	Zyphern		ah okay

2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	elyon		Does the Linux kernel in Ubuntu get updated automatically?
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	abdusabri	Hi	When trying to configure (xgl), i had this error and tried searching the web, any ideas :)
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	abdusabri	-	compiz-kde: Depends: compiz (= 0.0.2-4ubuntu2) but 1:0.3.3-0ubuntu2~git2006112~edgy1 is to be installed
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon	yes in time
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	it comes through the update manager
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	so	it's not "automatic"
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		but it'll let you know.
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	elyon		But its not something I need to consciously go to a website every  now and then and check...
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig		well it is automatic, just not immediate
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon	no, it will show up in the update manager
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	Administrator	hi	quick question
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	elyon		Okay... and the actual update is automatic?  Or does it require a tutorial to do it? :P
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	scribebox		i have a happyily running ubuntu-server 6.10
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	familiar with the update manager? the orange square in the notification area?
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	scribebox		i want to add an aditional 250GB harddrive :D
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon	no, in ubuntu there is a little icon that shows up in the panel when you have an update, and you click on it and install them
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	elyon	BHSPitMonkey	- vaguely familiar... it's popped up a few times for me to update software.
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	the orange square will light up in the notification area, by the clock.  you'll click on it, put in your password, and see the updates at hand.
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	scribebox		ermm, how would i update the fstab/format etc etc..
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	elyon	Okay	excellent.  Thank you.
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	from there you can re-check, or click Install Updates
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	for kernels, it will tell you that it won't take effect until after a reboot
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	bruenig	scribebox	sudo fdisk -l, find the device name and format it like everything else in the fstab
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	scribebox		no ..
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	scribebox		i want to format it to ext3 (maybe reiser..)
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	scribebox		and ive never really messed with the fstab :s
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	scribebox		if i post the output of fdisk -l
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	scribebox		on a paste
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	scribebox		and my OLD fstab
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	scribebox		can someone make me a new fstab :D
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	scribebox		so i can just ftp it over ;p
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	scribebox		and be done with it...
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	scribebox		and maybe i can learn by example..
2007-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	scribebox	with the new UID stuff, I am kind of behind, so I am probably not the best help
2007-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	amicrawler		songbird is cool
2007-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		yeah
2007-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I was thinking songbird was going to be really cool
2007-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		but it's actually pretty... bloated feeling
2007-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I think the browser-based music player thing is a big fat gimmick
2007-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		nobody cares
2007-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		it might as well be a firefox extension
2007-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	amicrawler		yeah i know

2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	mwe	byp	I don't know why they don't have a minimal install cd
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	jasin	cyber	you should only lose your settings if you do a complete removal first
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	amanmehta	ok	
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	byp		aye
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	Cypher		its the new year man
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	byp		yup
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	Cypher		bad things will happen
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	cybercod		ok... i'm about to try it
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	mwe	byp	ubuntu has a hugh dvd as well as the small install cd
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	jasin	cyber	i would still back them up though :p
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	tell me about it...
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	byp	yeah	but I use the CD for backwards compatibility
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	cybercod		Now he tells me
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	byp		some of my comps don't have DVD drives
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	skyde		why dont merge kubuntu xubuntu and ubuntu together and choose your desktop a login time
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	BHSPitMonkey	about leetspeek, you mean?
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	jasin	cyber	if you is doing a complete reinstall of the entire system you may lose some settings, if you is just reinstalling some packages everything should be fine.
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	skyde	you can, just install the other *ubuntu-desktop packages
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	skyde	because that would make the installer more complex than it needs to be
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	mwe	byp	but ubuntu has apt-get so if you have internet you don't need to have all the software on a dvd
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Madpilot		and you'd be back to the multi-CD installs other distros have
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	pretty much. That "u" "r" "2" "4" crap makes my eye twitch.
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	byp		That's what I like about it, mwe
2007-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	byp		I just rely on apt to get my software - I don't like having superfluous CDs
2007-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	jasin		you can install whatever desktop you want, sudo apt-get install kde for example, installs kde
2007-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	mwe		security patches don't make it to those CDs either
2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	skyde		what are you thinking about opensolaris
2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	jasin		security patches have to be downloaded
2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	byp		faster download+install than windows update :P
2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	jasin	byp	definitly
2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	they don't have to be downloaded seperately in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	jasin	use the 'kubuntu-desktop' for KDE/Kubuntu, rather than just 'kde'
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	cybercod	yeah	and you don't have to reboot unless its a kernel patch
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	if their not included on the cd they do.
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	they get installed with the software the requires them when you apt-get it
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	my point is you don't need the cd in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	cybercod		so far I've installed all four... xubuntu edubuntu kubuntu and ubuntu... i like just regular ubuntu the best
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	not if you have internet and use apt-get
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	jasin		try sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	yeah what about that?
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	it works fine
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	apt-get downloads its how it gets every update.
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	cybercod		whats the apt-get equivalent to *.*?
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	its still downloading them its just ussing apt-get to do it
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	because the updates are integrated
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	Flannel	cybercod	you don't want to do that.
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	byp	XD	
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	cybercod	??	
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	byp	lol	
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	n2diy	apt-get	update
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I know. I said you don't have to download the patches SEPERATELY
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	no their not, apt-get goes to repositories, thats where the security patches are from.
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	da_sweTT		fuck you
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	no their not, apt-get goes to repositories, thats where the security patches come from.
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	zeax_	=	=
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	of course it goes to the repos and dont repeat
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	what's your point?
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	blah, you are arguing semantics
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	talk to someone else
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I'm not buthead
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	byp	terminology	my friends?
2007-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	da_sweTT		you sweet
2007-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	da_sweTT		gtty78
2007-01-01T10:05:00.000Z	byp	dd	takes so long on my iPod...
2007-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	DBO	da_sweTT	it would be really swell if you could lay off the personal insults from now on =)
2007-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	jasin	cyber	aptitude is nearly the same as apt-get
2007-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	byp		it can search too
2007-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	byp		and has an ncurses interface when no args are used
2007-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	byp		but i find the ncurses too confusing
2007-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	jasin	apt-get	is not confussing its very easy to use
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	makuseru	apt-get	is the best of the package managers
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	jasin		if you want a graphical front end for apt-get then use synaptic
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	makuseru		of any distro
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	byp		aptitude's ncurses interface is confusing*
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	byp		i like apt-get
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	makuseru		i hate YaSt
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	jasin		I like apt-get too
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	jasin		yum is similar to apt-get but thats not included in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	mwe		aptitude is not the same as apt-get. aptitude keeps a seperate log which makes it possible to aptitidu install kubuntu-desktop then aptitude remove kubuntu-desktop if you decide you don't want it. try that with apt-get and you'll see it's doesn't remove kde
2007-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	byp	apt-get	is just a wrapper for dpkg, right....?
2007-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	byp		like yum is a wrapper for rpm
2007-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	mwe	byp	kinda yeah
2007-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	Flannel	byp	no.  apt-get is the http interface, it uses dpkg to do all the installing though, if that's what you're getting at.
2007-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	byp	k	thanks
2007-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	makuseru		anyone else noticed that Vista rips of alot of stuff from OSX?
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel		!offtopic
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	ubotu		#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	mwe	byp	does yum enable you to install something over the internet or only local rpms?
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	byp	internet	
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	jasin		if you can't get somethign off apt-get then its not apt-get it either doesn't exists with the package name you are ussing or you need to edit the repository list to look elsewhere
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	gostview		happy new year to all :D
2007-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	mwe	byp	then I think it's similar
2007-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	mwe	gostview	you too ;)
2007-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	jasin		I found the kubuntu-desktop on synaptics.
2007-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	jasin	use	kubuntu-desktop
2007-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	jasin	makuseru	yes
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	unikon		is there any way i can get xmms to be my default mp3 player    xmms is what i want to play shoutcast playlist but that option never comes up
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	tyme-	yast	sucks
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	tyme-		its buggy as hell
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	jasin	makuseru	some of the stuff in vista looks irraly similar to stuff thats been in os x and linux for years.
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	tyme-		i downloaded 3gb of data from system update and NOTHING was installed and cache was cleared
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	hear, hear
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	byp	jasin	Vista and GNOME title bars...
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	jasin	byp	what?
2007-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	byp		I think they looked the same
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	jasin	byp	oh, yeah ..
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	Suse was the first distro I ever used... it's lucky that it didn't completely turn me away from linux :P
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	makuseru	jasin	ya, i saw a video on simalartities with OSX and alot is the same, teh weather stuff, calender, search
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	makuseru		and microsoft always clamis to be "innovating"
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	tyme-		i just removed suse and installed ubuntu tonight
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	hahaha	
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	tyme-	im	never going back.
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	byp		I swear I remembered the title bars being the same
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		do they really claim that?
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	makuseru		yes
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	XD	
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	makuseru		in every interview ive ever ready or seen
2007-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		wow
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	makuseru		the said that their "aero glass" is pusing limits of desktop computing
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	mwe	tyme-	but suse is a decent distro as well don't you think?
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		now they're just making jokes of themselves then
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	makuseru	please move non-support chat to #ubuntu-offtopic or elsewhere. Thanks.
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	byp		by robbing us of valuable RAM
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	tyme-		its decent, but buggy and slow compared to ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	tyme-	ive	only had ubuntu for a couple hours, suse for months
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	makuseru		when you can use Beryl and do so much more with 1/4th the computer
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	ootput		hi guys, can someone point me in the direction of some documention on running different WM's on different displays?
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	you also used KDE, though, right?
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	mwe	tyme-	Yeah I heard complaints about the slowness before
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	byp		Microsoft is too constrained, whereas Linux, such as the interface, can be customized to your heart's desire
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	jasin		i'm a student so I have tohave a working word processer and abi-word seems to be the best in linux but it still dont work as good as word 2003, so i'll probably have to run vista in a separate system.
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	tyme-	gnome	.
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		that would contribute to that...
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	ootput		with ubuntu's startup mecahnism in mind?
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	tyme-		i do not like KDE
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	makuseru	meh, compiz :)
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput	jasin	that's a little extreme ;)
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	tyme-		beryl > compiz =] 
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	you don't like openoffice I take it?
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	does OOo not do it for you?
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput		running vista for a working word processor
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	jasin	openoffice.org-writer is the best word processor in Linux
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	jasin	ootput	runing word 2003 in wine is messy
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	tyme-	when is the last time you tried compiz?
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	byp	arrenlex	i agree
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	tyme-		two days ago
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	jasin	arrenlex	open office slows down the system.
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	makuseru		eww compiz
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput	jasin	with vista, you'll end up getting much more than you'd bargained for ;)
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	jasin	It shouldn't. Is this an old computer?
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput	jasin	yes it is
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	jasin		In linux I use gnome office
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	arrenlex	no, [text editor]  and LaTeX is the best word processor for linux
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	tyme-		i reinstalled the distro tried compiz one last time then went back to good ole beryl.
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	Amaranth	tyme-	was it the compiz package in edgy?
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		openoffice is admittedly a resource hog of sorts
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	jasin	ootput	I wouldn;t pay for it anyways, so its no big deal.
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		built on java, is it not?
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	ootput	Flannel	++
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	tyme-	Amaranth	compiz package from suse
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	arrenlex	jasin	If your system can't handle OOo, how do you expect to run Vista?! xD
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	ootput		what you see is what you mean
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, it is, I use abiword
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	haha	
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	ootput	hell	you can even use lyx at first
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	arrenlex's question... so true
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	mwe	Flannel	I use latex for all me reports. Introducing it to someone used to using MS Word would probably scare him away though ;)
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	tyme-	imo	java is horribly slow and full of memory leaks
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	what editor?
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	tyme-		it takes massive amount of memory and cpu power for a single app
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	for latex?
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		yeah
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	emacs
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		ah
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	ootput	ah	same
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	jasin	arrenlex	oh my system can handel it just fine I just choose not to hog up resources having it installed.
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	byp		vi
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	with the acutex package
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	ootput		there's a vim-latex package, iirc
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	ootput		but I'm very satisfied with Emacs for latex
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I still like using WYSIWYG editors that look purdy
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel		vim-latexsuite
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	ootput		yeah
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		emacs is a little too gritty for me
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	arrenlex	jasin	Vista running in a virtual environment is, in your opinion, less of a resource hog?
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	ootput		something of the sort
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	even beginning to compare OOo to vista as a resource hog is laughable
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	jasin		who said I was goign to run vista in a virtual enviroment?
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	ripperda		I'm seeing an annoying wireless ethernet problem, that I was hoping someone could help me with
2007-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	byp	xd	
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	tyme-	ripperda	ask the question
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	byp		that would help
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	ootput	no	he'd rather run vista instead of word2k3 in wine
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, windows is a memory hog.
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	tyme-	ubuntu	supported my wireless card out of the box
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	jasin	tyme	mine too
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	mwe	ootput	does word 2003 even work in standard wine?
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	ripperda		I'm trying to run WEP, if I set the essid & wep key manually via iwconfig, everything works fine. but if I set those via the /etc/network/interfaces file, ifup doesn't seem to pick up the changes
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		mine too, but I still needed to get network-manager and stuff to use it.
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	ootput		it may support his wireless card, but could be very shitty to use
2007-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		which I had to bring on a disk
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		with its dependencies.
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	mwe	ootput	don't you need crossover or something?
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	ripperda		I'm sure I'm doing something stupid wrong, just can't quite figure it out
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	what card?
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	ootput	mwe	i think it works for jasin; I haven't tried it myself
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	ootput		no real need :)
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	mwe	nah	
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	some belkin. f5d7000 or something like that
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	jasin		I dont run word 2003
2007-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	ripperda	tyme-	thanks for any tips
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	ripperda		I suspect that this is a config problem, rather than a device/driver problem
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	tyme-	ripperda	im not sure, not a linux guru. i could be consired a newbie =)
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	it showed up as a network device ootb, but IMO Ubuntu needs to ship with network-manager (applet)
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox	ok	
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		i got a new harddrive in my ubuntu machine
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	tyme-		i thought it did, BHSPitMonkey
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		got it formatted to resierfs
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	nope.
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		and mounted it under
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	tyme-		actually im positive it does
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	tyme-	ubuntu	6.10 did
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		/server/250GIG
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		and now im trying to edit the fstab file ;S
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	umm, I would have noticed.
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox	im	tottally confused about this
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		UUID crap
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	scribebox		can anyone hlep :)?
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	byp		?
2007-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	tyme-		i never installed a network manager app, it came with the distro
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	byp		SUID?
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	I have a disk with the packages I had to collect to install nm-applet
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	tyme-		i can set essid/wep key etc
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	tyme-		i dont use NM
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	scribebox		UUID
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	jasin		you have to have the hex key for your wep  to do wep, you can put the hex key in your network settings.
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	ripperda	tyme-	no problem :)
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	I said that IMO ubuntu needs to ship with it.
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	tyme-		why? it ships with an app that does the same thing
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		it's blatantly anti user-friendly
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	ripperda	jasin	how do I do that reliably? I set that in the config file, but it doesn't seem to catch. I have to set it manually every time via iwconfig
2007-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	jasin		if you are in kde or kubuntu you can use kwifi
2007-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	tyme-		the live cd was able to pick up my card and allow me to set essid / wep key
2007-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		something that a basic computer user could do in XP (connect to a wireless network) requires moderate skill in Ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	jasin	ripperda	you have to put it in your network settings and also kwifi if you are ussing kde or kubuntu.
2007-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	it also gets really fun with WPA and its variants.
2007-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	mwe		what's the difference between kde and kubuntu in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	Boknoy		I was wondering if anyone knows of a decent freeware app for x86 emulation for the purpose of testing distros in Windows before deciding which distro to switch to? VirtualPC type of thing, but freeware... don't want to be formatting and reinstalling all the time just trying to decide which one to use
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	jasin	ripperda	you have to set it for eth1 if thats your wifi, too.
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	mwe		I thought kde in ubuntu was kubuntu
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	tyme-		possibly, but i just use WEP
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	makuseru		it is isnt it?
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	tyme-		secure enough.
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	not necessarily
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	ripperda	jasin	unfortunately, not using kde/kubuntu. what do you mean by "network settings"? my wifi device is eth0
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	eh. All I hear from people is that WEP is a joke, as far as getting into an AP.
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	Boknoy	qemu
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	arrenlex		!qemu | Boknoy
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	byp		WPA > WEP
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	ubotu	Boknoy	qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	tyme-		it is if you spend the time to collect the 2-4 million packets to decrypt
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	pitdicker		Can someone help me installing fglrx 8.24.8 on Ubuntu Edgy?
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	well I know the kubuntu-desktop installs a lot of krap. I suppose that's the difference then ?
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	Boknoy	Also, MS has released Virtual PC. It is now free.
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	tyme-		airsnort does a good job of helping people crack WEP keys
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	byp		that's where aireplay comes in handy
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	jasin		if you use wep use 128 bit
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	so Ubuntu shouldn't let users easily use WiFi?  Oh, and consider the method you have to use to connect to a network, if you were on a laptop and roamed.
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	jasin		both wep and wpa have been cracked
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	tyme-		but you also have to collect millions of packets for it to do so
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	Kubuntu uses KDE, but if you used Ubuntu and installed KDE, it wouldn't be Kubuntu
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	im on a laptop and used wifi out of the box
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	jerp		aptitude gives me the 'can not get lock' response I've checked the sysguard and I don't see anything running.    adept isn't running, synaptic isn't installed
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	tyme-		it clicked the applet on gnome task bar, entered in required info and i was connected to my network
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	what if I installed ubuntu then kubuntu-desktop?
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	byp	jerp	root?
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	so every time you want to use a different AP, you go and redo your settings? (Oh, and also cross your fingers for WEP)
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	isn't the default window manager the only difference?
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	jerp		like sudo aptitude ?
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	byp		aye
2007-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	Keeguon	Hey	I'm trying to compile fleox plugin for banshee but I got this "No package 'tao-opengl' found" so I suppose I have to do something with the Tao framework but what?
2007-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	well yes, the default network manager app that ships with Ubuntu isn't advanced enough for that
2007-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	jerp	byp	yes, and the terminal display appears and that is where I get the warning
2007-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	byp	hmm	not sure
2007-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	kubuntu is just a packaged distribution... to say that just having KDE is having Kubuntu, it to say that running GNOME means you're using Ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	byp		error message =
2007-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	jasin		There are lots of ways to secure wifi, connect over a vpn, use mac filtering, set your network to run over a subnet not directly off the main network, use authentication,etc..
2007-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	but all you have to do is get the internet up and running, add and remove packages you want or dont need (network manager) and its fixed. I can see this might be a problem for linux newbies but with a little brain power and research it wouldn't take that long to figure out
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	difference between ubuntu and kubuntu is that ubuntu installs ubuntu-desktop whereas kubuntu installs kubuntu-desktop instead
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	network-manager is an official gnome component, it has a very nice interface, excellent little "bars" icon on the notification area... it really needs to just come with ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	jerp		I ran adept just now and  get,
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	right, after a base system
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	jerp		You will not be able to change your system settings in any way (install, remove or upgrade software), because another process is using the packaging system database (probably some other Adept application or apt-get or aptitude). Please close the other application before using this one.
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	which they both install
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	identically
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	jerp		the application opens though
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	kubuntu-desktop includes KDE, tailored the special ubuntu way, with all the things that make ubuntu ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	ubuntu-base is the same
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		right
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	jasin		you can mask yoru ip address with a proxy, tinyproxy works great for doing that in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	scribebox		hello
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	scribebox		anyone wanna help me fix my fstab?
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	jasin		there are lots of things you can do to secure wifi
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	the point is, on both my systems, and on my friends whose I set up, I wasn't able to use wireless out of the box. It required me to collect network-manager and its dependencies on a disk, or plug the computer into an ethernet router.
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	AFAIK installing kubuntu-desktop and removing ubuntu-desktop from a standard ubuntu install gives you exactly the same as if you installed kubuntu in the first place
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	byp	jerp	hmm,  not sure - check ps and look for anything that might be using the database
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	byp		:/
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	jerp	ps	?
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	byp	ps	-A
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	jerp	ok	
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	and WiFi is frankly an area in which Ubuntu just falls short to XP, and it doesn't have to.
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	why? what was so difficult? If you can use windows network manager to add an AP you could easily do so in Ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	byp	jerp	ou might want to pipe it through less...
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	tyme-		Linux and Windows = Apples and Oranges
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	jasin		the kubuntu desktop is kde its just configured and has icons that dress it up, make it look a bit prettier.
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	the equivalent to using windows' AP connection tools is network-manager.
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	tyme-		of course it's going to be tougher in Linux, but Ubuntu does a great job of giving you all the tools you need right out of the box
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	jerp	byp	I don't know what that means   (I carry newb credentials)
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	byp		Are you saying apples are better than oranges???
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	hastesaver	mwe	BTW, installing the package kde installs even more "krap" than kubuntu-desktop
2007-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	byp		:P
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	jasin	wifi	works great in ubuntu if you have the right card.

2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	jasin		my wifi nic is actually supported directly in the kernel its self.
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	mwe	hastesaver	it does? Personally I installed kdebase then added stuff ;)
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	pitdicker		Can someone help me installing fglrx 8.24.8 on Ubuntu Edgy?
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	tyme-		ipw2200 jasin?
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	byp	jerp	then look for anything that might be using the so-called software database like synaptic, apt-get, aptitude, dpkg, whatever else
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		in XP, you click on an icon, and a list of APs comes up. It supports various encryption types. In fresh Ubuntu, you have to figure out the networking properties' version of a wireless configuration tool, figure out some confusing stuff, and pray you're WEP or unprotected.
2007-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	jasin	yep	ipw 2200 bg

2007-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	Ubuntu's focus is making something that anyone can use, at least as intuitively as one could use Windows.
2007-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	tyme-		suse's 10.1 kernel had ipw2200 support, but it dont work :P
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	hastesaver	jerp	run this: ps aux | egrep "dpkg|apt-get|aptitude|synaptic|adept"
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	you're right, it doesnt show the AP's near you, you have to actually set ESSID and Hex key.
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	jasin		making linux more like windows will only mess up linux
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	tyme-		but if you have no idea how to do that, why would you install linux in the first place?
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	tyme-	jasin	in some ways, but mostly it's a good thing
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	just because I can accomplish something in ubuntu, doesn't mean I'm satisfied with how it was implemented. Nobody would bother developing an easy-to-use system, since developers are power users anyway.
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	jasin		i'm all for ease of use but making it like windows is stupid
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	byp	hastesaver	you made it easy :)

2007-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	I'm more concerned about being able to tell people that they can have success with ubuntu, and be able to keep to my word...
2007-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		Is there a prog in linux that can make picture cd's with fancy transitions and music
2007-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	right on. i agree the shipped app could be a LOT better but it works if you're using it at home and already know how to connect computers to your network
2007-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	it's really disheartening to have to go back and watch aspects fall short, after I tell people the superiority of linux
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	if it's a stationary computer, it's essentially "stranded".
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	jasin	ubuntu	is very easy to use its just dont seem easy to use because it falls short it supporting most hardware.
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	jerp		don't know what it means but wth
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	byp		jerp:that sounds redundant...
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	it picks up and connects to any AP without encryption
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	and sometimes that's not acceptable
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	jerp	byp	I guess I'm cleared now :)
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	jasin		however, ibm and dell both have laptops with everything installed and preconfigured .. thats always a good way to go.
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	byp	jerp	good luck :)
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		saying it's good enough for a group of people doesn't satisfy me :)
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	jerp		on the road to happier cybering,  at least for the mean time.
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	you can't say that for ANY application
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	tyme-		I personally do not like Network Manager
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	jerp		thanks byp and hasteserver
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	tyme-		nor use it.
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I really back Ubuntu, but I'm allowed to find problems with how certain things have been implemented
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	hmm	
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		that's better...
2007-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	well, it's very likely you dislike most of the utilities that make up ubuntu.
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	tyme-		Not true. I love ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		why?
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	tyme-	imo	it's the best distro that i've ever installed.
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		yea me too
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		and I installed them all
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	tyme-		I've only had it for 3-4 hours now and i feel that way.
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	lol	
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		impressive, linuxeatswindows
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		indeed...
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	tyme-		thats a lot of distros linuxeatswindows
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		after the first few thousand distros, I'd personally get frustrated and give up
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		for me, the first hundred
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		:/
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	jasin		I was reading a post on the ubuntuforums the  other of a giy who uninstalled ubuntu and installed freebsd because it didn't support his hardware well, it was bugy.
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I tried all the ones I heard about most often
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	tyme-	BHSPitMonkey	same.
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		all the major ones, I started with one I got out of linux format
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, lol
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain		i want to split HD partititon(resize and create new one),should i do it with gparted or within windows?which one is better?
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	tyme-		Mandrake for almost a few months, went back to windows
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	tyme-		then decided windows blows and im never going back
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	tyme-		so then Suse->debian->Suse
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	ubuntu	is the first distro that I was able to make my primary (and near-exclusive) OS
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	do it with gparted
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	tyme-		now Ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	tyme-		and i <3 Ubuntu :P
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	tyme-	you sound just like me :P
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	tyme-		i went back to windows for the gaming.
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	tyme-		only reason.
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		so I've tried Debian, Slackware, Redhat/Fedora, Mandrake, College linux, Onebase, Knoppix, Ubuntu, Gentoo, SuSe, VidaLinux, and lots more
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	then when i reboot to windows,will it recognize the new partition?
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I went Suse->Bunch of Random Mainstream Distros->Mandriva (all with Windows primarily), and then Ubuntu made the pushover.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	hastesaver	sc4ttrbrain	if you want to resize the Windows partition, and you can do it on Windows, do it there... at least you won't blame Ubuntu if it fails :-)
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	get the gparted linux livecd, download the iso and burn it to a cd, boot with that and set up your partitions from there.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	tyme-		Oh i had redhat for a couple days. wasnt that great.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyme-	same situation actually
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	tyme-		I'm a die hard Ubuntu fan now though.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I used to have like 6 OS partitions that I would rotate out various distros on
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	same	.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	tyme-		it's insanely faster than Suse
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	same	.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	tyme-		i have NO idea why
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	tyme-		but it is.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	lol	
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	after their set up with that restart the system and boot into the ubuntu installer with your ubuntu cd
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	i have gparted installed, why should i use live cd? is there any other differeneces?
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		for me setting up Ubuntu with Automatix makes my life easy... The only thing I can say for Ubuntu is it would be nice if it came with a firewall installed by default like on Fedora
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	uhh	*Kough Kough* ;)
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	tyme-		After using YaST last night i got fed up and downloaded Ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	tyme-		and boy im glad i used YaST and it's buggyness
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		Yast4debian is defunct which sucks
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	tyme-		or else i wouldnt have switched
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	YaST	is NaSTy
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	because you can setup the partitions outside of the ubuntu install cd
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	i ve running ubntu :D
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	tyme-		it truely is.
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	tyme-		HORRIBLE
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		indeed
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	if you are runing ubuntu why do you need to partition?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		not a good first impression of linux, using Suse.
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	tyme-		Mandrake (back when it was mandrake) was my first impression
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	tyme-		and it impressed me :P
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	NoPulp	yast	was ok .. but very slow and crappy lol
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	NoPulp	Thus, not ok?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	tyme-		I've only recently came back to Linux (3 months ago) and it's surprising how far it's come.
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I'm going to be the first to say that this conversation is grossly off-topic :P
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	i ve 3 parttion windows,data,ubuntu, i want to split data into data and mac,because i will install mac on it
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	tyme-		Has been for awhile.
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	NoPulp		i know thats why the "lol"
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	hastesaver		I first started with a Knoppix LiveCD, used Red Hat 9 for a few days, then went to Mandriva, and been only using Ubuntu since Hoary.
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	tyme-		this is a support channel, not a discussion channel :P
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		:P
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	Rookie_		!offtopic
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	ubotu		#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	NoPulp		my first linux was red hat 7.2
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	how do you intend on installing mac
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	tyme-		but theres just so many people here contributing to convos :P
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	tyme-	btw	happy new years everyone
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	using .img and dd
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		anyone know of a prog to make picture cd's in ubuntu with music and transitions?
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		aye
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		huh?
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	tyme-		i've sobered up since coming on IRC apparently :P
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	tyme-		i actually hit my head on my door coming into my room.
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	are you on a PPC system or an intel/amd?
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows	lol	
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	I never set up my partitions within linux, I like control over how their set up, I like to low level format, check for errors, setup separate partitions not outside of linux in case i run into error,etc.., but thats me.
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain		BHSPitMonkey; im on pc
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	and you're dd'ing from an Intel mac?
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	jasin	i like to run shred before partitioning/formatting
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	I never set up my partitions within linux, I like control over how their set up, I like to low level format, check for errors, setup separate partitions outside of linux in case i run into error,etc.., but thats me.
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	tyme-		time for bed, night everyone.
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	no
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	jasin	hyper	no need if the drive is low level formated
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	linuxeatswindows		night tyme-
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	jasin	just personal preference - I'm paranoid :P
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	jasin		hyperb0 hehe
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	jasin	hyper	i understand :)
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	I think you should instead be using PearPC, either within Ubuntu or Windows. Or both, and keep the disk image and config in the data partition.
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		yup
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	no,i want to boot it natively
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain		just need to split partition safely,which i dont know how
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	am I really the first to point out that you can't do that?
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	cant do what? install mac? havent u heard macosx?
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	lol	indeed I have.
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	jasin		if you are going to do a secure wipe you should make no less then 30 passes with a dod complient wipe.
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		it's been out for a few years now.
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	jasin	hehe	
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	byp	jasin	xd yeah
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	yup,i mean,as long as u have sse2 or 3 u can install mac on it right?
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	byp	jasin	but the failsafe method is incineration, of course
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	and it runs on PowerPC processors.    There's also osx-x86, which is what runs on the "new" Intel-based macs, but you can't use that on a normal PC.  At least, not without using an illegal, hacked version
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	jasin		that in combination with a low level format, and not just a zero fil low level format, will destroy virtually any data left
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	byp		indeed
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	byp		i've been trying out dd for my zero-filling, lately
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I hear it's better to use random bits than zeros.
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	dont worry,even though im using it ,i will only use it to know whether its worth to buy ;)
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	byp	BHSPitMonkey	that's what I use shred for
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, that is true
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	and as far as "safely" splitting that partition, 1) Backup, 2) Delete, 3) Make Two, 4) Restore Backup
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	byp		you could always also do dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/foo
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	heh	
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, over writing again and again with random bits and bytes is the best way to destroy data.
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	byp	jasin	nah
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	byp	jasin	just nuke the drive
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	byp	jasin	with a nuke
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		put the drive in a microwave
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	jasin	byp	i wanna keep the drive lol
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	byp	jasin	:P
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		then crush it into a powder and distribute it into several differently-located meals
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	cant i just use gparted > 1.unmount that part. 2.resize 3.create new ?
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	jasin	byp	I dont use thermite unless the drive is total dead
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	jasin	lol	
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	seshomaru		is there a gnome application that allows me to connect rempotly to other boxes graphically?
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	byp	lol	
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	byp		VNC
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	resizing a partition is ALWAYS dangerous.
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	byp		not GNOME though
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	KenSentMe		!vnc > seshomaru
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	seshomaru	KenSentMe	do i need to apt-get it?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Hey	where is ubotu?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	BHSPitMonkey	how dangerous? :D
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	never do a resize unless you're prepared to deal with the possible consequences. (Losing it all.)
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	is it absolutely impossible to backup this data
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	ubotu	ping
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	ubotu		64 bytes from ubotu (10.13.37.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.33 ms
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	seshomaru	KenSentMe	does the remote machine need to have VNC as well?
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	byp	seshomaru	server, it does
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	KenSentMe	seshomaru	on the machine you want to connect to, go to System - Preferences - Remote Desktop and do the right settings. Then use Applications - Internet - Terminal server client to connect

2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	jasin		you need 7 partition, root / , /usr, /var, /home, swap, /boot, /tmp make home and usr the bigest, boot at least 100 megabytes and swap 2.5 x the total amount of memory installed.

2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		not in hyperb0lix's case, but yeah
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	klaus		(i tried autofs, but wont work for floppy)

2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	sc4ttrbrain	personally, I've never used partition magic.
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I can't say how safely it works.
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	sc4ttrbrain	fdisk ftw
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	lol	
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	jasin		I have partition magic on a boot disk, runs frm dos, it works fine for creating linux paritition, except for it limiting you to 2 gig swap partitions.
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Madpilot	ok
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	yes	fdisk will take special care to make sure you don't lose any data...

2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	why would you ever need anything bigger????
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	klaus		is autofs the regular way under edgy for automounting floppy-discs ?
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		1GB is as big as I've ever made them
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain		thanks
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		and that's excessive
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		I tried a 4.5 gig swap partition for fun
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		How's that for excessive?

2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	ubotu	Sorry	I don't know anything about tao-opengl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, swap shoudl be 2 times total memory installed, thats a standard rule of thumb.
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	jasin	not quite
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	that's not applicable anymore.
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	KenSentMe	seshomaru	i don't know that. Probably there is a way
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	mensur		does anyone know where to get that package "tao-opengl"???
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	jasin	I was reading the OpenBSD installation guide, and that's not true
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	jasin		if you want to swap all your memory or half of when you run out yes it does.
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	jasin	although I seem to have broken it with a 4.5 gig swap partition
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	a PC with 2GB of RAM, for example, doesn't really need a swap partition. (even though ubuntu requires one, I hear)
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	KenSentMe	seshomaru	maybe check here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH or https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	jasin		BHsp, depends on what one is doing with that system.
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		I should make a 70GB swap... then 5GB /......
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jasin	if you're doing tasks which require over 2GB of ram, in that case, swap isn't going to cover it.
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	ubuntu	won't fit, eh?
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	seshomaru	KenSentMe	thanx
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	jasin		I have 2 gigs and the system nevrr usses the swap, btu i dont really do very intensive things.
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		if hard drive swap was preferable, we wouldn't have RAM
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		swap wouldn't be a tolerable replacement for ram if a program demanded more than what was provided
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		More RAM
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	jasin		BHSp, thats why linux only runs resources out of ram when their used.
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	jasin		Bhsp, you is right though, its alwaus bets to use ram rather then swap.
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	jasin		best*
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	BHSPitMonkey	unless Edgy's installer has changed things, you can still order Ubuntu to install w/o swap
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		And if you have plenty of RAM, you don't need an overly large swap partition
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	just basing on what I heard a few minutes ago from someone.
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	I've never tried to omit one
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	hyperb0lix		Better safe than sorry
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	BHSPitMonkey	when I had to reinstall Dapper I did not set up a swap partition, the installer complained once, then worked fine.
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	Madpilot		I've got 1Gb of RAM, don't need swap
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		indeed
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	JosefK		swap is useful for when app's request large blocks of RAM, most of which they aren't going to use yet
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	jasin		If your system truly does not use the swap ever and never will you can disabled it, easy enough to do in nough to do in /etc/fstab
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	jasin		enough*
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		is there any benefit to disabling a swap partition you already have
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	jasin	josefk	yes
2007-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I mean, it's already there... there would have to be a good reason for me to go through the trouble of commenting a line in fstab ;)
2007-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	pitdicker		Can someone help me installing fglrx 8.24.8 on Edgy?

2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	pitdicker		I need an older version of fglrx becouse my DVI doen't work
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	pitdicker		It seems 8.24.8 works

2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	shemale		well normally when I let the ubuntu setup resize
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	i want to send files using terminal from my linux pc to my shell, i had used scp for the backwards process. can it be done the other way using scp?
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	shemale		automatic resize setup do his work, theres no problem, and it goes to step 6 of 6 , but now im stuck at step 5...
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	compengi	sure, if you have the user and IP of the other machine, and it has an ssh server installed
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	tripppy		anyone useing mvTV python script?
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	shemale		is it possible that my hp tablet has blocked any configuration change to the partitions
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	pitdicker		building it with the following commant fails:
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	pitdicker	sudo	module-assistant build,install fglrx-kernel
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	jasin		I have no idea where you can get 8.24.8, sorry.
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	do the entire erase option.
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	i used scp like this. scp user@shell.machine.here:/folder/here /to/my/directory/
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	shemale		yah thats what im thinking but the thing is
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	shemale		I dont want to lose the windows partition
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	that wont set up all the separate partitions you need but it will set up the minimal, enough ti get you up and runing.
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	and that was copying process
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	shemale		with the all the shit I wanna keep
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	no, you will erase the entire disk
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	and now i want to copy from my pc to the shell machine
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	compengi	So the other way would be scp /to/my/directory/ user@shell.machine.here:/folder/here/
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	shemale		but what about the windows partition...
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	shemale		its on the disk
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	shemale		so you are saying theres no choice ?
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	okay let me try it then
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	either backup or use the gparted linux live cd, http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	anyways, you shoudll always backup regardless/
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		yah
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	anyways, you should always backup regardless.

2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		ill partition my disk

2007-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	shemale		maybe someone could give me remote assistance on that one
2007-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	seshomaru	shemale	is that the graphic interface or the command line ?
2007-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	use that live cd I gave you a link too, you can setup the partitions outside of linux with it .. it might make things easier for you.
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	shemale		graphic interface
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	samuel		sup all
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	jasin		shemal, just resize the partition and after its resized setup two partitions, a root partition / and a swap .. make them primary.
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	set them up in the free space left over after its resized
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	shemale		yah okey but the thing is I have to do it with the terminal caus theres a fuck with the graphical
2007-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	no, set up the partitions with the live cd I gave you a link to
2007-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	mwe		which ghostscript is recommended, gs-gpl, gs-esp or gs-afpl?

2007-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	also, you may want to download a now iso for ubuntu, burn a new copy, sounds like yours is messed up.

2007-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	seshomaru	shemale	and defrag windows before resizing it
2007-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	shemale		maybe theres a scratch on the dvd

2007-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	gaten		!sound
2007-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	ubotu		If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin

2007-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	shemale		very appreciated
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	yes, just toss the disk and burn a new one.
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	you is welcomed :)
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	cybercod	shemale	you could also use partition magic to resize first from windoze and click "install to largest free space"
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	shemale		yah but the iso is on my windows shittt ?%$%%/$% so I have to log out from Linux :(
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	could tell me please how to delete a dir from the ssh?
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	shemale		yahh
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	shemale		thats what I can do
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	cybercod		you can access windows partition from live disk
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	shemale		but I can also do as Jasin told me
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	compengi	'rmdir' is the command
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	shemale		with gparted..
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	cybercod		you just have to mount it... in Disks
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	shinobi3		hi
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	compengi	tonyyarusso	it says directory not empty
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		its read only, but you may be able to burn the ISO.... i dunno if live disk has burner ready to go
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	shemale		what is better gparted or partition magic ?
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		may also depend on how much ram you have for the ramdrive
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		Part Magic is a little more polished
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	shinobi3		is there a way to reformat my flash drive? like totally redo that parition table? i think i screwed it up with 'dd'
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		but each has their limitations
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	compengi	there's an option in the man page if you want to delete a non-empty directory
2007-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	shemale		I have 1.5 Gbs ;)
2007-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	cybercod		you may have to use synaptic to install burning into live disk session
2007-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	cybercod		not sure on that point...
2007-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	spasti		is livecd very fun?
2007-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	cybercod		live cd is about the same as the freshly installed desktop, but runs slower
2007-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	cybercod	shemale	check IM
2007-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	jasin		I always have a backup computer to burn iso's from when installing linux hehe
2007-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	shinobi3		exit
2007-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	shinobi3		quit
2007-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	cybercod		i keep a pristine DVD of all my OS ISO's
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	cybercod	shemale	still there?
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	phr34ck		what does LTS mean?
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	cybercod		Long term support
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	phr34ck		Like Ubuntu 6.06 LTS?
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	phr34ck	cybercod	do you know why they say that?
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	cybercod		I think its like 3 years of dedicated support
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	phr34ck		I mean, what's the idea?
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	cybercod		maybe 5
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	phr34ck	cybercod	thanks.
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	jasin		I got mom's computer, the computers in the cne lab, the computers in the cis lab, that old junky pIII in the closet, and my desktop hehe
2007-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	cybercod		thats how long they'll support it in the forums and such

2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	cybercod		so you have an install that is not mounting them automatically
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	cybercod		oh..
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	cybercod		no grub menu?
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	cybercod		or is it straight to windows
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	you will have to rebuild the mbr for the time being if you want to boot back into windows

2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	koyo001		i have instruccions that tell me exactly how to do it
2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	AidanL		I see but there is an error when the comptuer is booting up...
2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	AidanL		a Grub error.
2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	cybercod		there will be an example for windows booting... the name doesn't matter thats just the label for the option. ... something to do with chainloader
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	cybercod		you'll see it
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	AndrewG	hi	I'm needing help manually installing grub, how do we do it?
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	cybercod		koyo... is that a laptop internal card?
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	koyo001		yep
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	cybercod		ok... wait lemme research where i found the answer before when i was going through that
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	AidanL		If I write over the partition which has Ubuntu on, will that then stop the problem with the Grub error?
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	cybercod	AndrewG	... get the UltimateBootCD
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	cybercod		you can find torrents of the ISO pretty easily
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	AndrewG		not that easy :S
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	AndrewG		we've only got an [k] ubuntu cd to work with
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	AndrewG		can it be installed off there?
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	cybercod		no... that won't Aidan.. it will probably make it worse
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	AndrewG		talking to a guy at the moment on the phone, he's got no internet, just ubuntu
2007-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	cybercod		Hmmm... there is an install grub command, but I forget what it is... i'll be gone a few moments for research
2007-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	AndrewG		thanks :)
2007-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	koyo001		humm

2007-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	AndrewG		grub-install /dev/hda1 would do it wouldn't it?
2007-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	jasin		This is what happens folks, if you install linux and the installation fails and you already had windows installd you will not be able to boot windows, grub, the program that loads linux got installed ahead of windows and didnt have time to be setup to load windows.
2007-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	shemale		yah but what if
2007-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	koyo001		if i sent the post where it gives specificacions on how to do it??

2007-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	jasin		There are two ways to fix that. 1. you can startup the computer with a boot disk and type fdisk /mbr from the dos command line go into windows do what you need to, then reinstall linux or 2. tell grub if you are able to get back into linux to load windows, you will need to edit the grub.lst file to do that, someone already gave instructions on how to do that.
2007-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	nivekz		hi there. i meet a problem. the official repositories that can be choose in synaptic are only "main" and "US". I used to have a local mirror. How can i get it back, i need it
2007-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	jasin		This is what happens folks, if you install linux and the installation fails and you already had windows installd you will not be able to boot windows, grub, the program that loads linux got installed ahead of windows and didnt have time to be setup to load windows.

2007-01-01T12:04:00.000Z	arty_name	Hello	. How can I replace a module which is automatically loaded, even in recovery mode?
2007-01-01T12:04:00.000Z	cafuego_		replace?

2007-01-01T12:05:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	linux will nto prevent you from going into the bios, no os will.
2007-01-01T12:05:00.000Z	arty_name		I've compiled up-to-date module from sources and now I want to put it in place of old module.
2007-01-01T12:05:00.000Z	koyo001		yeah thats where i have the problem
2007-01-01T12:05:00.000Z	koyo001		with ndiswrapper
2007-01-01T12:05:00.000Z	AidanL	Cybercod	sorry for the late reply. The thing is, is that I deleted the parition that Ubuntu was on because I was having problems with it. Thats why I was getting an Grub Error.
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	koyo001		when i use the terminal
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	koyo001		the terminal tells me that the command doent exist
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	shemale	jasin	I know that
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	AidanL		And my Live CD wasn't working, despite 2 different downloads of it and matches of the MD5 sum.
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	press del or f2 or f12, whatever you is asked to, when you first startup the computer from a cold boot.
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	cybercod		Aidan... this on laptop or desktop?
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	AidanL		Desktop

2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	cybercod		no prob
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	unplug the computer, thnen plug it back in and press the power button, thats a cold boot.
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	shemale		my tablet the keyboard wasnt ansering... so forget about F10 or F12 or del
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	shemale		okey
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	shemale		lets try with the battery alone
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	cybercod		koyo... perhaps you were not rebooting after blacklisting, and before installing ndiswrapper
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	if you is in linux you can type poweroff from the comand line, that will shutdown the computer as well
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	koyo001		no one said to reboot
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	june		anyone set up a mediawiki before?
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	cybercod		the page I just gave you does
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	samuel		sup all
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	cybercod		it is due to that other driver being installed already
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	cybercod		so uninstall ndiswrapper and ndisgtk
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	shemale		yah but like I said im chatting with you via my desktop comp, but its my tablet pc that is messed up
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	Gosha		what kind of package does 'ping' send?
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	cybercod		make sure the blacklist entry is correct
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	cybercod		reboot
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	samuel		why does amd64 arch boot in greyscale only? seems to have no colour while the x86 has colour to it?
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	samuel		is that normal?
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	apotri		sup all
2007-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	cybercod		re-install ndis-stuff and load up the windows driver for the wireless via ndis... you do have the windows driver right?
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	cybercod		any luck yet shemale?
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	Gasten	Gosha	I think there is that kind of info on wikipedia.
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		ohh man cybercod
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		this is strange
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		the bios startup
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		is taking soooo long
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	computer		what's the ubuntu equivalent of konversation?
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		and like after 45 secs
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	cybercod		i hate those days
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		my bios boot up password is appearing
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	cybercod		gaim works for irc
2007-01-01T12:11:00.000Z	shemale		but the problem is my keyboard is not answering...

2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		but thats weird im pretty sure that even If tried to install linux, it didnt messed up with my keyboard
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	samuel		does ubuntu have a "sid" version?
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	cybercod		I'd power down, remove batteries, remove cmos battery (if you can get to it), and let it chill a little bit
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		yah
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	cybercod		then the bios may be in better shape
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		yah
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		some shit like that
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		now I remember
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		on my desktop
2007-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	shemale		it was complety fucked up

2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		and by miracle
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	jasin		always backup yoru data, even if you dont think you need to. If you is not sure what to back up in linux you can backup /  and /home and in windows c:
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		all was working again...
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	DBO	shemale	watch the swearing
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	samuel		i know feisty fawn now is like "sid", but is there a "constant" sid that you dont need to change your sources lines?
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		sorry
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	cybercod		desktop motherboards usually have a jumper for bios reset... but i know nothing about tablets
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	jasin		Thats assuming / is the only partition you have
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		I dont want to offend anyone
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		yah I dunno either
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		for laptops or tablets
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	just relax its not that bad.
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	computer	thx	samuel and gasten
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	cybercod		you could google the model number and find some stuff..
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	basvg		um, I just upgraded from dapper to edgy... now I have 2 problems. Whenver I start a terminal I get 'To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".' ... quite annoying. Any idea how to turn that off
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	where you live?
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	basvg		the other issue is that every time I login I get the mail-notification popup
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	shemale		Montreal Canada
2007-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	cybercod		well gentlemen, for those of you who remember my question earlier about reinstalling all packages...i am doing it now...
2007-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	samuel	basvg	must be in your .bashrc file or perhaps the system bashrc
2007-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	basvg	samuel	didn't change my .bashrc .... I'll check /etc/
2007-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	samuel		if you use bash
2007-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	basvg		of course
2007-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	samuel		thats only 1 problem though
2007-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	basvg		the other one is the mail-notificaton popup... if I start gnome-session-properties then I see 'mail-notification --sm-disable' in the startup programs... and I can't seem to remove it
2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	cybercod		you can't disable it?
2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	okay, you could try contatcing the Montreal Linux Users Group, maybe they can help you physically in person. There website is: mlug.ca
2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	samuel	basvg	preferences -- sessions
2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	samuel		should be in there
2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	samuel		just get rid of it
2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	basvg	cybercod	right, I've disabled it...lets see if  I still get that nasty popup
2007-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	samuel		i know feisty fawn now is like "sid", but is there a "constant" sid that you dont need to change your sources lines?
2007-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	basvg	samuel	that s the same as running gnome-session-properties... trying to just disable it brb
2007-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	samuel		yes
2007-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	not saying you have to its just a suggestion if you get stuck and run out of options for what to do.
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	basvg	ok	that helped.... *shrug* pity that I can't remove it but disabling helps so..
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	shemale		yah okey thank
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	cybercod		any luck on the cmos battery?
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	shemale		you
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	shemale		Ive taken out the main battery
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	shemale		now I have to find the cmos battery...
2007-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	cybercod		should be accessible... a small panel maybe?
2007-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	samuel	ok	time for bed... happy new year!
2007-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	samuel		:)
2007-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	cybercod		good night samuel
2007-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	shemale		yah happy new year everyone

2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	shemale	lol	
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	shemale		but the thing is
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	shemale		I was having very nice intentions
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	shemale		installing ubuntu on my tablet
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	jame1		I'm trying to get a Safecom SWLU-5400 USB wireless adapter to work under ndiswrapper. It will install the driver (as seen in ndisgtk) but it says hardware isn't present - it is. How can I get it to work please?
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	ddwagnz		:/
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	cryptic	ubuntu	sounds like fun
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	shemale		so many great reviews...
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	cybercod		you may be grabbing the wrong file... which file you selecting with ndiswapper?
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	official INF from manufacturer
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	cybercod	ubuntu	is a blast
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	shemale		but I just dont know why my bios is messed up
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	shemale		thats strange...
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	cybercod		are there more than one file in the driver package?
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	but I did try to compile the ubuntu zd1211 driver... not sure if it's conflicting but then I disabled it via modprobe -r zd1211
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	shemale		my tablet found a strange way to celebrate the new year
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	yes but only for 9x, ME etc - i chose the provided XP one (only three/four files)
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	cybercod		tried all files individually?
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	including .sys etc?
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	hehe
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	cybercod		i had one driver that ndiswrapper took something other than inf
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	shemale		yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	shemale		it worked
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	cybercod		;D
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	shemale		I just reinstalled the main battery in
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	shemale	cybercod	
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	shemale	im	gonna marry you
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	shemale	LOL	
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	we gave you the tools, knowledge, and resources to fix your computer .. now all you have to do is fix it :p
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	cybercod		with a name like shemale... i think I'll have to pass
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	yeah i tried all three files, it only accepts .inf but maybe i should do it via terminal?
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	shemale		lollll
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	shemale		no doubt about that
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	shemale		I would have do the same
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	shemale	lol	
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	cryptic	hm	i should help in translating some programs to french
2007-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	cybercod		i doubt it would make a difference jame
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	kenthomson	HELP	there is a windows partition (FAT32) mounted by default by Ubuntu, and its icon is visible on my desktop, how do i know the mount-point of this partition?
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	cybercod		its probably mounted in /media
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	hm then do you think it's a conflicting ubuntu driver - the zd1211 one?
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	cybercod		you can also find out in Disks
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	thehotcornet		better ?
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	jasin	jamel	yes, do it from the terminal, use ndiswrapper -i filenamehere.inf
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	cybercod		you may need to blacklist like for broadcom... i dunno
2007-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	basvg		thanks for the help all
2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	jasin	jamel	if the file is on the desktop you will have toi change directory to the desktop cd /home/namehere/Desktop
2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	cybercod		if ubuntu has a driver for it that isn't working, you'd need to blacklist it before using ndiswrapper
2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	jame1	jasin	that's what i did, it says driver is installed but no hardware present - so  i thought maybe blacklisting or stopping a built in driver (zd1211)
2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	thehotcornet		windows is starting
2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	I want to navigate the contents of that partition from the terminal, what should i enter "cd /media/hdb1"? or what?
2007-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	jame1	jasin	it's ok, i did "-i /home/jamey/wireless/[nameof-inf-file] "
2007-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	jasin	jamel	ok
2007-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	ok that works! now what i want to do is create a mount point in my home directory for that "hdb1" partition, how do i do that?
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	jasin	jamel	you know what i did? I just took the wifi nic out and replaced it with a cheap intel wireless pro 2200, worked like a charm.

2007-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	cybercod		you'll see the current entry for the fat32 partition just change the path there
2007-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	cybercod		if you want to manually mount it you can use Disks
2007-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	cybercod		just make the folder first

2007-01-01T12:32:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	i thought there was a simplec command like "mount <partition> <mount point>"
2007-01-01T12:32:00.000Z	kenthomson	jasin	same to you :)
2007-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		Do "man mount" in a terminal to know... :-)
2007-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	any help please?
2007-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	cybercod		jame1... you could just reboot... or Ctrl+Alt+Backspace may do it... there's probably a mount command but I don't know it
2007-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	jame1	cybercod	ok cheers
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... i'm sure there is... i'm just familiar with the gui... i'm learning the command line little by little
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	cybercod		i'm not a guru in here or anything
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	june		hey anyone know where i can get the falcon repository builder so that i can install it on a webserver which i don't have root privileges to?  Is it even possible?  I have a folder to which i have read write and execute access though
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	cybercod		just slightly ahead of the curve
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	please explain this to me "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000", i want a explanation for "-t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000" ONLY, and the man page is too cryptic :)
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	jame1		vfat is the partition type, iocharset means it will parse filenames in UTF-8 format, and someone else can explain umask
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		tnx jame1, you beat me to it... :-)
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	kenthomson	jame1	ok
2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	kenthomson		what is "-t -o"?
2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	kenthomson		and "umask"
2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1: will this work? "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows vfat"?
2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	jame1		"-t vfat" is specifying the type (vfat) and "-o iocharset=utf8,umask=000" is specifying the two parameters, iocharset and umask
2007-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	jame1	kenthomson	why don
2007-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		see http://www.tech-faq.com/umask.shtml for explanation about umask
2007-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	jame1	kenthomson	sorry, i meant why dont you just use the provided command?
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1:  So "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows -t vfat"
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	jame1	becuase i dont want to input extra parameters like umask whose meaning i dont even know!
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		UMASK is a Unix environment variable which automatically sets file permissions on newly created files.
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	jame1	kenthomson	it's ok, it is in the official docs, they are safe parameters - they work fine
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	jame1		plus it mounts read only, so no damage
2007-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	kenthomson	jame1	i want read+write
2007-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	jame1	kenthomson	i believe it's called ntfs-3g
2007-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		hold on to the defaults, they just work fine in most cases
2007-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	jame1	thelinuxguy: thank you and have a nice day :) BYE
2007-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	cybercod	ubuntu	can read and write fat32

2007-01-01T12:41:00.000Z	Boknoy		hello how to view proxy squid?so i could test my proxy squid in winxp browser if its workin or not
2007-01-01T12:41:00.000Z	cybercod		isn't it like -rw or -w for writing fat32?
2007-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	jame1	Boknoy	you have to set the machine running the proxy as the proxy server on the winxp machine
2007-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	cybercod	it's -rw
2007-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		-ro for read-only...
2007-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	Boknoy	jame1	its different box sir
2007-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	cybercod	linux	makes me feel like such a noob
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	Boknoy		jame1:i just want to test it in windowsxp
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		remember you're first days on windows ? ;-)
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	jame1	Boknoy	what browser are you using?
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	computer		but at least one that's on the right tract
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	Boknoy		jame1:firefox in windowsxp
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	cybercod		yeah.. i changed an option in the bios and the damn thing never booted up again... but thats not windows... thats just me being stupid
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	computer		does firefox not work on cnn.com, if ur using linux?
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	Boknoy		jame1:and IE
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	cybercod	computer	. you got flash installed?
2007-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	computer		i  meant does mplayer plugin for firefox not work on cnn.com
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	computer		yes i had flash 9 installed
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	computer		but it says
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	computer		no windows media player
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	computer		no video for u
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	computer		sucks =)
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		cybercod; select "boot in defaults" in your bios to restore things ?
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	kenthomson		one more thing, i want to access System>administration>Disks, but the item "disks" is not listed, moreover from edit menus also there is no entry for Disks under Administration, how do i get that utility?
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	jame1	Boknoy	well in Firefox, open the options dialog and click "Connection Settings". There you can specify a proxy server
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	cybercod		I've had issues myself there... i'd be interested in hearing the solution to that
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	computer		but when using konqueror, it says can't detect windows media player version, so videos for u is ok =)
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	jame1	Boknoy	then you just type in the IP address of the machine running proxy and all requests will be routed through it instead
2007-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	cybercod		actually it got worse than that... being a complete idiot at the time... i tried to take out the bios chip... broke a pin on it and had to order a new motherboard
2007-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1 cybercod could you please help me with the above question?
2007-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	yeah	cybercod, that does not sound very healthy... :-(
2007-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	cybercod		I realize now I probably could have bought a replacement bios... but if I had known stuff like that I wouldn't have scewed it up in the first place
2007-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	cybercod		that was 10 years and many PC's ago
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... shoot
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	one more thing, i want to access System>administration>Disks, but the item "disks" is not listed, moreover from edit menus also there is no entry for Disks under Administration, how do i get that utility?
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	Keeguon	computer	have you tried the MediaPlayerConnectivity Extension on Firefox maybe it'll work...
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		sorry kenthomson, I'm using strictly kde here... no gnome....
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	Boknoy		jame1:i dont know my proxy in ubuntu =/
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	cybercod		Hmm... moment kenthomson
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	Boknoy		jame1:how to know and view the proxy and port?
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	any special reason for your inclination towards KDE?
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	jame1	Boknoy	I've PM'ed you
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	i used KDE and found it to be too cluttered, and favouring the ZEN mentality i shifted to GNOME

2007-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	and there is some reason for everyone's taste, so my question is what in KDE suits your taste?:)

I still have the old one (a s3 pci) in my computer and today I inserted a Geforce MX in the AGP slot. My VGA cable is connected to the Geforce MX but when I try to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it detects the card as a S3 but I want it to detect the Geforce MX (which is now supposed to be my primary graphics card). Can anyone help me getting xserve
2007-01-01T12:53:00.000Z	lilly		i want a shell script to run at boottime. where shd i add the code to?

2007-01-01T12:53:00.000Z	jamey31	tomplast	instead of letting it autodetect the module, select the correct one in the list
2007-01-01T12:53:00.000Z	basvg		but I'd prefer banshee as it has a much better/nicer interface

2007-01-01T12:56:00.000Z	kenthomson	tomplast	If you are getting any display when you have connected your monitor to the new display card, that means that X has recognised it
2007-01-01T12:57:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	only one version how gparted can exist at a time, so your question is infact bsaeless :)

2007-01-01T12:57:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	If you used synaptic it would have asked you to remove the older gparted if you wanted to install a new one "conflicting packages"

2007-01-01T12:58:00.000Z	cybercod		perhaps you don't have it installed... else it would be in your menu

2007-01-01T12:58:00.000Z	cybercod		try looking for it in the repos
2007-01-01T12:58:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	and then "sudo apt-get install gparted"
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	phr34ck	kenthomson	on what basis does it upgrade it?
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	defcon8		I do not see an option for a torrent file anywhere
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	i looked for "disks" in the repos but got obscure results
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	phr34ck		is there an official website ?
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	there doesn't seem to be any package availeble that's providing disks-admin in ubuntu ?
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	if you do "sudo apt-get upgrade", all your installed software including gparted will be updated so theres no need to install/download a new version
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	phr34ck		I see, thanks.
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	yes
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	phr34ck	Well	I downloaded like 80 upgrades yesterday
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	phr34ck		I just run apt-get update, yes ?
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	"sudo apt-get update"
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	lilly		i want a shell script to run at boottime. where shd i add the code to?
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	defcon8		can someone tell me where the torrent is for ubuntu 6.10, please?
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	defcon8		simple question
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... it is definately disks-admin... look for it in repos
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	the command seems to be gone, it was there before edgy...
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	defcon8		http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3rnJE0LC7I

2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	kenthomson	lilly	please don't paste again and again, if someone is there he shall answer
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	defcon8		To use BitTorrent, choose a link from above corresponding to a location near you. You will see an option for a torrent file.
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	defcon8		I do not see a bloody link to a torrent file anywhere
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	no result found in synaptic
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	doesn't work in 6.10
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	cybercod		you got weird repos?
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	defcon8	why would you want to torrent it? Download it simply via the site
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	defcon8	kenthomson	the servers slow
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	no my repos are not broken nor malfunctioning, they are perfectly fine
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	like I said, it used to work in Dapper !
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	defcon8	its not likey that you shall get a faster speed via torrent
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	phr34ck		Man .... what the hell is wrong with SUDO ? I'm always getting Timespan something
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	defcon8	patience is the key, try a different server
2007-01-01T01:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	if you are using graphical apps try "gksudo <app_name>" as in "gksudo gedit"
2007-01-01T01:03:00.000Z	phr34ck	kenthomson	what does that do ?
2007-01-01T01:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	thelinuxguy: now where do i get that "disks" thing in System>administration?
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	thats the same as sudo but for graphical apps it behaves more nicely :)
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	cybercod		Ken its disks-admin in repos
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	I've found it: install with "sudo apt-get install pysdm"
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	cybercod		there we go
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	cybercod		nice
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	there is nothing like "disks-admin" in repos
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	phr34ck	kenthomson	I see, thanks.
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		then you will find it under system...Administration.....Storage Device Manager
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		Reply With Quote
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	cybercod		ok.. sorry for misinforming
2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	phr34ck		same problem man ... timespan too far in the future ...
2007-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	thank you for informing, help is much appreciated can you tell me how did you find it out
2007-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	I searched the ubuntu forums on http://www.ubuntuforums.org
2007-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	:)
2007-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	cybercod		i love those forums
2007-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	now that the package is installed what command do i enter at the CLI to get that disks thing?
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	kenthomson		disks-admin doesn't work
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	cybercod		i wish I was in gnome but i can't change now
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	kenthomson		psydm too doesn't work
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	phr34ck	Hey	I'm trying to install GCC 4.1.1 but I cannot do it since I'm having this error: C compiler does not exist.
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	phr34ck		What am I suppose to do ?
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	cybercod		its not in menu ?
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	install build-essential
2007-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	nothing in menu
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		I already have it.
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		kenthomson; read the whole thread on http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=317742&highlight=disks-admin+in+edgy
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	if you do, then ``gcc -v'' should work fine
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	fotoflo2		what is remote desktop called in ubuntu
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	fotoflo2		?
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	kenthomson	crimsun	could you help me? I am on GNOME and am trying to get System>administration>Disks, but that entry doesn't exist. nor is it on edit-menu>Administration, so i installed package "psydm" now how do i run that Disks package?
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	let me do that
2007-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	the thing is that I'm launching the configure file found inside the folder.
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	crimsun	kenthomson	I have no idea what you're referring to (no experience w/ those)
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	phr34ck		so it checks and everything, and then it stops on C compiler./
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	cybercod		phr34ck... perhaps the configuration script creates another executable?
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	what are you trying to compile?
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	phr34ck		it does locate gcc, but it says that the compiler cannot process C or something
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	phr34ck		GCC 4.1.1
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		kenthomson; it's possible that you need to logout - and login - to see the changes in the gnome menu...
2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	euan	Hi	I've manually stuffed up my X setup.  Can someone tell me which script the installer runs so  I can invoke that?  Seems the script's cleverer than me :-)
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	phr34ck		I don't know what the configure file is doing.
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	err, why? gcc 4.1.1 is included with ubuntu.
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	worked like a charm! Thank you, and one more thing this "psydm" thingy is not the same as "System>admin>Disks" But it shall work well too
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	kenthomson		Have a nice day! happy UBUNT-ing :) :) :)
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	how can I know that?
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	phr34ck		feeling*
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	cybercod		I'm not good at building
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	what's the output from gcc -v ?
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	cybercod		... yet
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	sorry for the misinformation its the same thing :)
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		kenthomson; glad I could help ! Happy New Year ! :-)
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	phr34ck		hold on
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	euan		I'm stuck with a 640x480 desktop, that's the max available to me.  Before I stuffed it up I could go as high as 1600x1200 (not that my eyes could)
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	"Cheers" ! :-)
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	phr34ck		C compiler cannot create executables.
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	phr34ck	gcc	C compiler does not work.
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	that should not be the output from ``gcc -v''
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	phr34ck	okay	it gave me like 40 lines
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	kenthomson	euan	Do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and follow the simple instructions, sticking to the defaults as much as possible. IN the driver section select "nv" if you have nvidia card or VESA if you dont know, in the resolutions thing put a * by clicking space in the appropriate resolutions in that wizard
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	phr34ck		what are you looking for ?
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	euan		Thanks kenthomson, I'll try that.
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	the very last (bottom) line
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	J-_	euan	Did you turn on your computer before you plugged your monitor in? Same thing happened, I didn't have my monitor plugged in and I turned on computer, and the re. was low with no option to make bigger, so I restarted and it worked like normal. I had xubuntu installed on a dapper LAMP server.
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	kenthomson	euan	after that restart X by pressing "ctrl-alt-backspace" or simple reboot the computer
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	phr34ck		GCC version 4.0.3
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	are you using dapper?
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	kenthomson	J-_	nice insight :)
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	koyo001	ok	problem
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	J-_		Hope that works, heh.

2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	J-_	koyo001	do you have build essentials installed?
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	and can't dist-upgrade to edgy?
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	koyo001		tells me command not found
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	kane77	koyo001	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	kenthomson	koyo001	"sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	what ?
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	kenthomson	kane77	:)
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	dapper doesn't have 4.1.1, but edgy does.
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	kane77	kenthomson	hh
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	J-_	whoops	no 's' =D
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	koyo001	ok	will try that
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	kane77	kenthomson	funny :D
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	LinTux		how do I install the XFCE desktop in terminal
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	it's available on their website.
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Gosha		!svn
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	ubotu	svn	is Subversion: an open-source revision control system, which aims to be a compelling replacement for CVS. See http://subversion.tigris.org/
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	phr34ck		Why I cannot use it ?
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	kane77	koyo001	and sometimes you need to run ./configure
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	I'm not talking about upstream; I'm talking about Ubuntu.
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	kane77	LinTux	sudo apt-get install xfce4
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	I have no idea what you're talking about man.
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	koyo001		configure hyeon
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	koyo001		???
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	obviously if you want to bootstrap gcc 4.1.1, you're free to do so. Just make sure your toolchain's configured properly first, which means you need a working compiler, binutils, and l-k-h
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	kane77	koyo001	what are you trying to install?
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	if your compiler doesn't work, --reinstall gcc and cpp
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	koyo001	ndiswrapper	
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	LinTux	kane77	many thanks m8, HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	koyo001		need to run a windows driver
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	and make very sure that the toolchain components are properly installed (binutils, gcc, libc6-dev, linux-kernel-headers)
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	J-_		eww
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	since gcc 4.0.3 is installed .. how can I write C++ program.
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	I think I have them.
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	kane77	LinTux	happy new year to you too... youre welcome...
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		The thing is that everything is soo messed up now. I'm totally new and installing packages here and there.
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	you don't need gcc-4.1.1 to write C++ programs
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		no idea what I'm doing.
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	kane77	koyo001	isn't ndiswrapper available from repositories via apt-get??
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	all you needed to compile C++ programs is 'build-essential'
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	phr34ck		how can I organise my packages.
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	phr34ck		?
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	koyo001		humm not sure
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	what in the world are you attempting to do?
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	cybercod		koyo      read  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_install_Windows_Wireless_Drivers_.28Ndiswrapper.29
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	koyo001		i used gz
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Menisk		How can I install only the base system of 6.06?
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Menisk		I don't have the alternate install.
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	I'm getting familiar with Linux ;p
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	phr34ck	hey	I just ran ./configure and it worked.
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	phr34ck		What's next ?
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	koyo001		thanks cybercod
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	kenthomson		!shockwave
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	ubotu		Shockwave is currently only available for Windows. To run it under !Wine, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Shockwave
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	koyo001		still with the same problem
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	you still haven't stated what you're attempting to do...
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	kenthomson		Anyone having SHOCKWAVE running under wine on Ubuntu? I got some problems
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	cybercod		koyo.. describe... i think i missed it
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	kane77	koyo001	I'm not sure... there is ndisgtk, a gtk frontend... you might try to install that (sudo apt-get install ndisgtk)
2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	phr34ck		I wanted to have a decent C++ compiler. So I downloaded gcc and I'm here to see how to install it. I had no idea that there is a built in compiler
2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	kane77	brb	
2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	cybercod		there are dependent packages with the ndis packages... are you installing from synaptic?
2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	the C++ compiler is g++
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	phr34ck	yeah	I figured ..
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	phr34ck		So now I ran the configure script succefully, now what?
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Menisk		How can I install only the base system of 6.06?
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Menisk		I don't have the alternate install.
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	phr34ck		How do I make gcc 4.1.1 work ??
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	cybercod	Menisk	.  base system?  normal install?
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	phr34ck	meh	gcc is ?
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	you -already- have a working C++ compiler installed
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	kenthomson		!alternate
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	ubotu		The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	crimsun	gcc	is the C compiler
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	okay how to I work with it?
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	phr34ck		where is it ?
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	kakalto		I boot ubuntu in CLI-only, and the screensaver (blank screen) goes on every 10 minutes or so, how can I either change the time for this, or turn it off?
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	g++
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Menisk	cybercod	I only want the base system for a server, no window manager etc.
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakalto	there is some command to kill the gnome-screensaver
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	crimsun	Menisk	install ubuntu-minimal
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	phr34ck	kool	
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	phr34ck		is it a high end compiler?
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	phr34ck		or just a "built in" one ?
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	kakalto	kenthomson	does gnome-screensaver even run when there's no X?
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	what do you mean by "high end"?
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Siv0x		!nvidia
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	ubotu		To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	interesting question, without x there is no GNOME without GNOME there is no gnome-screensaver, so what you are seeing is not the screen-saver unless it is running in backgroun
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	kitsune1		hi all
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Menisk	crimsun	How do I do that from the live CD, or do I need alternate install?
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	kitsune1		happy new year !
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	it's part of all Ubuntu installs
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	I mean a very decent C++ compiler
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	in the text-mode try alt-ctrl-f7, and see whether you go to a X-login session, if yes, than X is running in background
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	GCC is very good
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	nn		collisions:23034 txqueuelen:1000
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	it's not shoddy software if that's what you're asking
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	if yes can kill x by "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	nn		Anyone got an rt2500 doing that too?
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	kitsune1		can anyone help me?
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	phr34ck	crimsun	but you said that GCC is not a C++ compiler?
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Menasim1	it's part of all Ubuntu installs
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	phr34ck		g++ is the same as gcc ?
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	g++ is
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	DarthLappy	kitsune1	With?
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	kenthomson		!ask | kitsune1
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	ubotu	kitsune1	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	g++ is a part of gcc
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	kakalto	kenthomson	do you even know what CLI means?
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	crimsun	phr34ck	no, gcc != g++ just as C != C++
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	kakalto		I run ubuntu-minimal
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	phr34ck	umm	
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	ofcourse
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	phr34ck		I see, so I downloaded the hole package, not just the C++ compiler.
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	kitsune1		well i took a pic ture of wat happens when i run ubuntu can u please ahve a look at it
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	kenthomson	kitsune1	link it
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	phr34ck		that's good, since I'm going to be using Java as well.
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	nn		If g++ is installed, the gcc frontend will invoke 'g++' on .cc, .cpp, and .c++ files
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	kakalto	kenthomson	then why are you telling me how to kill gnomescreensaver (I assume runs on X), and how to kill X... when I don't run X?
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	phr34ck		How can I take advantage of it >?
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	kitsune1		1 sec ill upload
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	that's gcj
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	phr34ck		it's not included in the GCC ?
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	but you are telling me that a screen save is running in the background
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	SubMOA		hello! What does "&lt;3" mean?
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	it's part of gcc, but a seperate package
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	<3
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	if there is a screensaver running than X is definitely running the background
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	a heart
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	phr34ck		I see.
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	cybercod		kakalto... can you find the process ID?
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	kakalto	kenthomson	I don't run X!
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	SubMOA		say what?
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	SubMOA		:O)
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	kenthomson	kakakoka	If not, than you shouldn't HAVE A SCREENSAVER!!!
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	&lt; is an HTML entity for the character '<' (less than)
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	phr34ck	woohoo	I just made my first C++ on Ubuntu ...
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	so &lt;3 is <3 in HTML :)
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	kenthomson	phr34ck	way to go!
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	SubMOA	nn	oOo, thank you so much.  Wow, you rock!
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	phr34ck		Why do I have to write this : ./testing ? why not just testing ?
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	:)
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	it's a safety feature
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kenthomson		Goodbye all! and have a nice day! HAPPY UBUNT-ing :)
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	phr34ck	nn	what does it mean ?
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	SubMOA		is ASCII an "entity" for text?
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	DarthLappy	phr34ck	"testing" will try and execute it from $PATh
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kakalto	kenthomson	it's not a conventional screensaver... the screen blanks after 10 minutes or so. This is the "screensaver" I wish to either change the time for, or remove completely.
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	./whatever means run 'whatever' from the current directory (.)
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	koyo001	helo	
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	phr34ck	nn	I see.
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	cybercod		oh... thats power management then kakalto... i think
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kakalto	cybercod	I'm not sure what the program is exactly, so I don't know how to find the pid
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kitsune1	ok	
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kitsune1		heres one
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kitsune1		http://img153.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dsc00184xw2.jpg
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	if you have '.' in your $PATH (DANGEROUS) someone could put a nasty program in the directory (which could compromise your machine)
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	phr34ck		Can't I use the GCC that I downloaded? It was a waste of time ...
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kitsune1		and another
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	kitsune1		http://img157.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dsc00186ly1.jpg
2007-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	and it would be ran instead of the program you want
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	no
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	phr34ck	nn	thanks.
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	since < and > are part of HTML markup, they can't be directly used
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	n1gke		Good morning everyone.
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	phr34ck		These are Linux in general, and not just Ubuntu, yes >?
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	instead &lt; and &gt; (and several others) exist for this purpose
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	yes.
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	it's a safety feature
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	SubMOA		ohh, I understand!
2007-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	SubMOA		thank you!
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	kenthomson_		a
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	phr34ck		where I can find Java interpreter ?
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	so that if you really want to run something from the current directory, you have to knowingly do so by say './whatever' (run whatever from current directory (.)
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	nn	SubMOA	np
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	kenthomson_		!java | phr34ck
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	ubotu	phr34ck	To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	phr34ck	nn	I understand mate.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	nn	phr34ck	you probably want jre, unless doing java development, then jdk might be better bet for you
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	kakalto	so	does anyone know how to stop the screen blanking after 10 minutes or so on ubuntu-minimal, in CLI-only, no X?
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	phr34ck		I need jdk, yes
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	nn	kakalto	that's APM
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	phr34ck		JDK requires JRE anyway
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	cybercod		kakalto.. hold a moment.. i think i got something
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	cybercod		reading

2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	phr34ck		but I do java programs, so I need the development kit.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	nn		oops
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	kakalto	nn	ahk, cool... any ideas how to mess with it?
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	koyo001	ok	
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	kakalto	cybercod	thanks, sounds good

2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kenthomson		I used open-source "nv" drivers and got 800x600 @ 85HZ, and when i switched to "nvidia" drivers i am getting 800x600 only at 85HZ, can someone please help? I have edited /etcX11/xorg.conf and put in the correct vertical/horizontal refresh rates of my monitor in the appropriate section, what else do i need to do to get 800x600@85hz, with proprietary-nvidia drivers?
2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	NineTeen67Come1		you too HymnToLife ..

2007-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	nn	fotofo	ahh not mounted already?
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	could you open a file (.pl, .zsh, .sh, anything that needs syntax highlighting)
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	cybercod		you'll need to find and print the instructions for doing it in the command line... and you can press Ctrl+alt+F5 to get command line access
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	fotofo		mounted
2007-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	fotofo		listening to an MP3 from it
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	fotofo	nn	i think i need to put "vfat" in there,
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	cybercod		glad to hear it fotofo
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	fotofo		not sure of the syntax
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	fotofo	cybercod	but i cant write to the disk
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	kitsune1	ok	i have no got ubuntu install its the live cd i trying to run first so i can install it
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	cybercod		kitsume  you'll need to find and print the instructions for doing it in the command line... and you can press Ctrl+alt+F5 to get command line access
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	vanberge	slacker_nl	yes
2007-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	slacker_nl	fotofo	vfat is correct
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	fotofo	slacker_nl	reading man... where's it go?
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kitsune1		were do i put the drivers so then i can access them
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	vanberge	slacker_nl	i have a php file open
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	nn	fotofo	/dev/whatever /media/windows vfat auto 0 0
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	nn		or similar
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	cybercod		thats one I don't know... I'd try to get hands on alternate disk, does anyone know a way to install from command line on live CD?
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	in vi, now do :set syntax
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	gnufied	NineTeen67Come1	I have the manual. its a viewsonic monitor, but bloddy they haven't given sync rates.
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	slacker_nl	fotofo	what nn says
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	nn		crazy but i remember all these things off the top of my head :P
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	vanberge	slacker_nl	E519:  Option not supported: syntax
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	slacker_nl	fotofo	or dou it manually: mount -t vfat /dev/device /mount/point
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	fotofo	sudo	mount -o remount, rw /dev/hda1    where's the vfat go?
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	NineTeen67Come1	gnufied	hum .. usually back in the back there are specs .. not only physical dimention, but input voltages, etc etc ..
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	nn		then again, i've been using linux for almost 10 years, *nix for hmm 13
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	are you using vim or vi?
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	kitsune1	cybercod	which drivers should i try
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	peija-kas		GMail Hacked: Visit ANY Website, and Your Whole Contact List Can be Stolen  http://epodaeta.notlong.com/  Works in Firefox, Opera, and IE. This link does not link directly to the exploit for obvious reasons.
2007-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	nn	fotofo	no space between the ,rw
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	fotofo	nn	only worked with the space
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	nn	fotofo	thats incorrect then
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	nn	fotofo	if unmounted, mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/windows
2007-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	:set syntax in vim should return syntax=php
2007-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	nn		mount -o remount,rw /dev/hda1 (or /media/windows) would turn on writing (and remount,ro turn it off)
2007-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	nn		i do this on my /etc :)
2007-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	cybercod		I'd give the proprietary Nvidia drivers a try
2007-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	nn		i boot up everything but /home is read-only (/tmp, /var/{lock,log,run} are all ram drives)
2007-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	nn		but i run off a thumbdrive too..
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	fotofo	nn	that didnt work
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	SubMOA		how would you register a password with IRC?
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	kitsune1	ok	when i get them were do i put them on so when i put in live cd then open the command line,, how whould i access the driver?
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	fotofo		not mounted or bad option
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	fotofo		but it is mounted
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	vanberge	slacker_nl	i thought they were one in the same?  i am typing vi from command line
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	HymnToLife	SubMOA	depends on the network
2007-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	fotofo		so it must be a bad option
2007-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	kitsune1		sry for so many questions

2007-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	ls -altr /etc/alternatives/vi this should be a symlink to /usr/bin/vim
2007-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	do you have that?
2007-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	cybercod		mmzin... i'm thinking...

2007-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	cybercod		should be ~/.wine/c_drive/program files/.......
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	let me try
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	mmzin	cybercod	i have to install steam on the same partition that linux are, right
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	slacker_nl	lardarse	that tells me /etc/alternatives/vi points to /usr/bin/vim
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	lardarse	slacker_nl	which command... ls -altr ?
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	slacker_nl	lardarse	yeah, ls -l will also do it :)
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	lardarse	ok	
2007-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	cybercod		mmzini don't have world of warcraft installed on same partition

2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	ok... I think vim.tiny shoudl also support syntax highlighting
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	slacker_nl	vanberge	any reason to use vim.tiny?
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	mmzin		when i kill
2007-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	cybercod		mmzin.. is there a preset for Steam?

2007-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	cybercod		kitsume1 first off i suggest you get a package called mined... its a text editor that works pretty well in command line... so Ctrl+alt+F5 then sudo apt-get install mined
2007-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	hexidigital		fotoflo_::  did you just finishing installing?
2007-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	nn		very likely the path/etc makes it too long to show
2007-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	cybercod		then ctrl+alt+F7
2007-01-01T02:38:00.000Z	hexidigital		kitsune1::  sorry, i assumed ubuntu was already installed... i dont know if dl-ing, then installing will work
2007-01-01T02:38:00.000Z	MuffY	kenthomson	ubuntu is on hda1
2007-01-01T02:38:00.000Z	fotoflo_	hexidigital	well, ive just installed it

2007-01-01T02:38:00.000Z	fotoflo_		but when i go to http://localhost/ it shows up
2007-01-01T02:38:00.000Z	hexidigital		fotoflo_::  try sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start (or just apache, depending on version)
2007-01-01T02:39:00.000Z	nn		i'll have to check out mined, i personally use joe
2007-01-01T02:39:00.000Z	hexidigital	hmm	
2007-01-01T02:39:00.000Z	MuffY	kenthomson	i installed in on hda1, and yes, first partition (only partition)

2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	nn		i really like joe.. been my favourite editor since i learned it
2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	MuffY	"sudo mount /dev/hda1 ~/ubuntuPartition ext3  iocharset=utf8,umask=000"
2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	nn		i really dont remember when ilearned it, either
2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	hexidigital		fotoflo_::  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	cybercod	well	i've been on linux less than 4 months.. so i'm sure I'll change my preferences over time
2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	nn		probably back in say 1999?
2007-01-01T02:40:00.000Z	hexidigital		kitsune1::  that is real wierd... newer video card, i assume?
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	nn		the keybindings are a bit odd, but once you learn them, very fast
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	phos		what is edgy support like for intel core2?
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	mamzers555		can somebody tell me, what extension i have to install to get a menu in nautilus that give me the option to encrypt files with gpg?

2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	cybercod		i feel i'm doing ok for such a little amount of time
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	MuffY	kenthomson	it wrote a qwhole lot of things
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	fotoflo_	hexidigital	same thing, but i got an error on reload
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	nn		it's pretty small yet very featureful and effecient key bindings once you lear
2007-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	hexidigital		kitsune1::  you can try this... apt-get download {your driver}, then copy it to a flash drive and install it after the install
2007-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	kenthomson	MuffY	Dont worry "cd ~/ubuntuPartition" then "ls" Do you see "boot"?
2007-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	hexidigital		fotoflo_::  what error? about fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1?

2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	hexidigital		fotoflo_::  dont worry about that... i have a registered FQDN, and i still get that error... i fixed it once, but dont remember how :/
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	fotoflo_		not worried about it
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	fotoflo_	im	more worried that theres no HTTPD pid
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	hexidigital		kitsune1::  another option would be to dl the alternative cd...
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	kenthomson	MuffY	"sudo mkdir /media/ubuntu"
2007-01-01T02:44:00.000Z	fotoflo_		and that i dont know where my httpd.conf is

2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	cybercod		kitsume... i think there's a way... but you'd have an easier time getting the alternate install cd and installing FIRST
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	MuffY		bash says /ubuntu doesn't exist
2007-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	MuffY	ftw

2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	hexidigital		kitsune1::  if you are not pressed on time, you could download the server .iso, and when that finishes installing (and if you can see your screen), you can sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop && sudo aptitude install nvidia-{your driver}
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	MuffY	bash	cannot create directory '/media/ubuntu': File exists
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	kenthomson	MuffY	after that "cd /media" then "cd /ubuntu"

2007-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	cybercod		and coming back in here will nullify getting mined because it will just be in ram-drive

2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	fotoflo_		it was like how to do a million things in ubuntu
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	BloodHunter	Ubuntu	is much more fast when i install it on harddrive, then running it with VMware?
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	fotoflo_		maybe it was someone else who sent it to me
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	HawkeV	BloodHunter	yes
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	BloodHunter	absolutely

2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	hexidigital		fotoflo_::  i dont think that was me that sent that link... lemme look in my sent messages.. hang on one sec
2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Zaggynl	BloodHunter	possible, but better not do that
2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	cybercod		next step will be to type in                       mined /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	BloodHunter		i mean, make the partition smaller
2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	kitsune1	cybercod	ubuntu works nicely in VMware
2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Zaggynl	BloodHunter	yup

2007-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	HawkeV		or if you're technically inclined, boot a livecd and use parted
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	BloodHunter		can i install ubuntu while i have win xp online? since i dont have a burner :P
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	HawkeV	BloodHunter	no

2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	cybercod		you're gonna look for sources that end in "restricted" and remove the # in front of them

2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	cybercod		you'll need to save the file
2007-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	HawkeV	BloodHunter	depends what you mean
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	HawkeV		but the short answer is 'yes'
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	cybercod		then you'll want to type in          sudo apt-get update
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	BloodHunter		k
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	adaptr	BloodHunter	connect in what way ? I know of at least 2 dozen I can use
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	fotoflo_	CheshireViking	yeah! thanks

2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	BloodHunter	thx	
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	cybercod		then you're gonna type in             sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	BloodHunter		ahhh got another question :P
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	BloodHunter		does ubuntu automatically install the drivers for graphics card, mainboard and so on, or i have to do that myself
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	adaptr		Wow.. it's gonna fetch like.. 1585 files to upgrade
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	HawkeV	BloodHunter	heh, most of them, yes
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	adaptr	BloodHunter	what video card do you have ?
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	HawkeV		if you've got some sort of whack hardware
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	BloodHunter	Geforce	7900gt
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	HawkeV		you may need to do some legwork
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	cybercod		next you'll type in            sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	fotoflo_		god this system is a pain in the bollocks
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	bjames_		hi all, firstly sorry for the stupid question, but does anyone know if I *need* to install an X server on a machine that's only going to be used via Xming logon?
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	HawkeV		for nvidia stuff, you'll need to do what cybercod is currently talking about
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	How do i access Ubuntu's (on HDD) FileSystem from a Ubuntu LIve CD?
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	assume liveCD is running and Ubuntu FS (the one on HDD) is on hda1
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	adaptr	BloodHunter	enable all repos and fetch restricted-modules for your kernel.. that includes the nvidia closed source driver, and you're all set
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	BloodHunter		how? :P
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	cybercod		and at this point you should be able to hit CTRL+ALT+F7 and get graphical interface back up with the new drivers
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	HawkeV	kenthomson	mkdir /mnt/ubuntu; mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubuntu
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	HawkeV		in a console
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	adaptr	BloodHunter	go to system -> synaptic and search for restricted-modules

2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	slacker_nl		!avi > slacker_nl
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	bjames_		"/join nvidia" without the quotes
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	is that Ubuntu-specific ?
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	cybercod		once you are at this point you should be able to install like normal... though I'd appreciate it if you start up GAIM and come tell us if it worked before starting the install.
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	cybercod		did you get all of that kitsune1?
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	bjames_	no	but it's the right place to go for support installing the prebuilt binaries
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bjames_		just an idea
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	kenthomson	HawkeV	ok
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	well, IIRC Ubuntu has some builtin "logic" to help you do this, so why not Google for it ?
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	kitsune1	hmmm	ok m8 thanks a million for your help ill try my best lol
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	it's at least 3 times easier than using nvidia's guidelines...
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Plinty		how can I mount a remove storage device (an mp3 player, which acts like a removable hard drive with FAT file system (not FAT32))
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	?
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	cybercod		hey kitsune
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	kitsune1		yes
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	you have to do at least 3 distinct things to get the vanilla nvidia binary to work, and Ubuntu pretty much does them for you
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	bjames_		I've installed Nvidia drivers before - the best place I found was form the Ubuntu getting started guide, but that's just my experience
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	kenthomson	HawkeV	How do i give read/write access to that partition you just mounted?
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	cybercod		if you can start up the live cd in VMware, perhaps you can check the syntax of this stuff before trying it for real
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	HawkeV		it should be read/write by default
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	HawkeV		unless you mean to any user
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	indeed, but it differs enough from the "official" nvidia way that newcomers probably don't want to be confused by it
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	bjames_		anywho, does anyone have a clue about my question?
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	kenthomson	ok	
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	klaus	Hello	with autofs i have probs automounting floppy - is autofs the right way ? or do i have to use udev? i am using edgy .... has anybody any ideas ?
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	what was it ? :)
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	kitsune1	hmm	gd idea
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	HawkeV		if you mean the latter, pmount may be a better idea, alternatively, you could pass -o umask=000 to mount, which should give everyone full access to every file
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I have Ubuntu server set up running SSH and SAMBA as a fileserver - do I need to install an X server on the machine in order to run graphical programs remotely (via Xming)
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	cybercod	bjames	someone was in here earlier that was using an ubuntu-minimal installation with no x
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I asked this over in "xorg", but none of them knew exactly
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	ah I see it - well, you *need* the libraries so that X clients can connect to your remote X server, and AFAIK they're only fully installed when you do the full Xorg installation.. you should just go with xorg and tell it not to start up a local X server automatically
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	cheers, I'll try and figure out how to do that
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	it is mnore relevant to tell your display manager (xdm, gdm, kdm) to do the right things, like A. not start the local X server, and B. open up XDMCP to network requests
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	have you had any experience with Xming?
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	so, gdm config, not so much Xorg config
2007-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	cyrus4		hey   im new to ubuntu,  ive installed the nvidia drivers or whatever   just wondering if n e one knows y my screen saver and other full screen video apps are like  stuttering...  its v annoying
2007-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I tried it a while back, and if you just set an Ubuntu desktop to allow remote X, it works pretty much out of the box... haven't had that much luck with a remote server though
2007-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	adaptr	cyrus4	that means you do *not* actually have the nvidia drivers functioning.. run "glxinfo | grep direct" as root
2007-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	hexidigital		cyrus4::  did you restart your GUI? (if not, log out, and press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace)
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'm pretty much a newcomer, so to be clear I need to    1) install x- server?    2) somehow edit the startup scripts(? ) to prevent it starting into gdm
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	hexidigital		cyrus4::  or, you may have to run dpkg-reconfigure xserver.xorg and select the proper newly installed driver
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	kitsune1	cybercod	thanks alot m8 for ur help im away to try it
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	alecjw	cyrus4	and have you told x to use the nvidia drivers?
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	cyrus4		yep yep  my mate set it up for me couple of days ago   everything should be sweet and i have a 6600GT   but cant play videos and stuff fullscreen without stutter
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	klaus		hey nobody here with any idea ?  with autofs i have probs automounting floppy - is autofs the right way ? or do i have to use udev? i am using edgy
2007-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	kitsune1		ill come bk later on and tell u how far i got
2007-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	fotoflo_		whats the chmod to make a script runnable?
2007-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	kitsune1		thanks agian m8
2007-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	cybercod		kitsune1... i forgot... once you get back into graphical by hitting Ctrl+alt+F7 do a Ctrl+alt+Backspace to restart the GUI
2007-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	kenthomson	HawkeV	mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/ubuntu  -o umask=000, gives full access right?
2007-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	alecjw	cyrus4	just to make sure, what happens if you type the command "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep nvidia" (sans quotes) in the terminal?
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	richee		hi narasim_7
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	narasim_7		Hi
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	halfway there.. you do need to install X, yes - it's called xorg-server or something, but you do want to start a display manager - it just should not start  the X server.
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	LameBMX	KenSentMe	that should give no axxess
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	ok
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	LameBMX	im	pretty sure umask uses same string as chmod
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	HawkeV	LameBMX	no, the way umask works
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	connecting to a remote X machine is done with the XDMCP protocol, which is part of the display manager - gdm in Ubuntu's default case
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	narasim_7		gnomesystemtools like users and groups , services etc dont ask for password anymore ... Is this happening to anyone ?
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	bjames_		in which case does it matter which I choose?
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	HawkeV		is the reverse to what you're thinking
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	HawkeV		777 - umask
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		022 would give you
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		755
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	(it'll probably be gdm)
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		or root r/w, world read/execute
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		000 = 777
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		which is world r/w
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	cyrus4	alecjw	yer   Driver     "nvidia"
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	LameBMX		then then why dont umask=222 give me write access on a ntfs drive
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	a little more technical: it is actually gdm that "tells" the X system to use the local X server as the users' display - but it could as well be a remote display
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	alecjw	cyrus4	that's starnge... can't help0 you then, sorry.
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	HawkeV		because you are a retard and you just ignored what i said
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	cyrus4	thx	n e ways :)
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	keep it nice
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	HawkeV		777-222 = 555
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'll tell you the whole story, just for clarity.  I'm thinking of setting up a fileserver and at the moment I've installed Ubuntu server 6.06 on VMware and had a "play"
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	HawkeV		or read/execute for everyone
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	rgr
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	LameBMX		and HawkeV is more likeyly right im a n00b and just goin but guesses based on what ive fiddled wit
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I'm running 606LTS as a file/web/mail/whatever server here, it's a beaut
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	what I want ideally is a minimalist install on hardware but that I can log into using Xming
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	rich232		what line do I add in menu.lst so that startup starts at 1600 by 1200?
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	HawkeV	LameBMX	basically, umask=022 would give root r/w, but no-one else
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	HawkeV		fwiw
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	that =kinda contradicts itself.. you won't have a minimalist install when X is possible
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	it was easy enough to set up so I'm happy with it so far on VMware - will be moving to hardware in a week or so
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	do you know what hardware ?
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	LameBMX		i think i wound up using the wordy version anyways
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	LameBMX		:)
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well temporarily a PIII 450, 1G RAM 40G HDD
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	adaptr		(running on HP Netserver E800 dual P3 here - it was kind of a "steal".. :)
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	Zaggynl	Hmm	I can't download the gaim source with 'sudo apt-get source gaim'
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	1GB of ram is in-sa-neey :)
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	Zaggynl		http://pastebin.ca/299132
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LameBMX		like i said HawkeV ... if something dont work the first time ... i just try different things till it does (after backing up of course)
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	HawkeV	LameBMX	i like that method of learning =)
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LameBMX		or in the case of xorg almost have memorized

2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well I don't know what to do relaly my *main* PC (Windows box) has an AMD x2 3800 3G RAM 400G HDDs so I was going to doneate some RAM from that
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LameBMX		yea .. i remember things better lol
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	not possible, believe me
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	HawkeV		dum-de-dum
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	LameBMX		all this talk about how stable nix is .. and i crash my box about 10 times a day ..
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	HawkeV	lol	
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	HawkeV	linux	is stable in a server environment
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	LameBMX		yea i understand

2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I might not donate any RAM at all as I have 128 + 256 sticks on the PIII mobo
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	LameBMX		crap about 3 years ago when i got my first computer ... windows installs didnt last a day
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	danny		hi guys I just wanted to know if there was any project in the near future to create a new sub distro for tablets, ex : Tubuntu..  that would be nice, spcially since more and more students are getting tablets...
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	a P3 uses single rate SDRAM, at 133MHz max., while an AMD 64 uses DDR SDRAM at 266MHz minimum - they're not ecxactly compatible
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	LameBMX		i could prolly resurrect about half of those now but dont really matter its how i learn
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	to be honest I've not looked at the RAM to see if they are compatible so probably
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	narasim_7		the power management in Kubuntu Control center does not work properly for me..it always becomes 2 hrs eventhugh i set it to 2 minutes ...
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	bjames_		oops
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	HawkeV		tubuntu...
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	lilly		how do i forcefully unmount a mounted image?
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	narasim_7		any ideas?
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	HawkeV		is it bad that that gives me bad mental images?
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	384 is  more than enough for the foreseeable future
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	good good
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	HawkeV	lilly	umount -l /mounted/thingy
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	LameBMX		been using a computer for all of 3 years and now i work fixing them
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	HawkeV		that's an ehl, not a one
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	lilly	HawkeV	ok
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	HawkeV		stands for lazy unmount
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	things you *do* want in a server are: 1. ECC memory, if you can get it, and 2. redundant storage.
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	HawkeV		and it should do what you want
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	lipe		I need some help, to install qt 4.1.4, please !!!
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	1. is a nice option to have, but 2. is non-negotiable - use a mirrored system disk at least
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	sukarn		can someone tell me how to build raid arrays (mdadm)? I have a single hard drive (80 GB) from weston digital. I am using 7.04 (testing), and there seems to be some problem with raid arrays in mdadm, causing initramfs-tools to fall back to emergency procedures. while i am able to boot with these kernels, the boot process is very slow, login takes a lot of time, and hard drive activity causes a lot of cpu usage
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	you only want ECC if your processor is compatible with it
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	the thing is I was thinking of long-term - I kind of want a system with RAID (when I feel brave enough) and I was wondering if it's possible to have it spin down the HDDs so they don't get too much wear and then use a large RAM buffer and only spin up the HDDS when needed
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	Grok_		can anyone recommend a good cd ripper/encoder for ubunbtu/linux?
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	HawkeV		otherwise you'll run into more underlying issues

2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	Dicander		I am running Ubuntu 6.10 inside a parallels virtual machine under OSX. I tried to install democracy player but got the error message dependency is not satisfiable: mozilla-dev.
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  please don't repeat... if someone know they will help... plus, you haven't described your issue
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	well, strictly, it is only useful if the *mainboard* supports it, but yeah.
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	ECC support is not dependent on the CPU
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	hexidigital		Grok_::  soundjuicer is pretty easy to use + efficient from what i have done
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	HawkeV	true	some CPUs do require it tho
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	Dicander		When I tried to install it using apt I got the message "mozilla-dev" has no release candidate and they suggested that I install libnspr-dev instead. I did, but the error remained. Does anyone know what I might try?
2007-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	HawkeV		woodcrest/opteron to name a couple

2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	I need to install qt 4.1.4 with an archive .tar.gz, and i need someone help for it ...
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	HawkeV		impe, putting ECC registered ram in a box with a cpu that doesn't need it just causes headaches
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	RAID requires no courage - only money :) if you use Linux softraid it works fast, simple, and very very dependably
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  ok... so, you're compling from source code?
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	for a server, spinning down the HDs is not an option.
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	LameBMX		oh wait i  do have a reboot issue .. ill brb with a screenie of my error ... now this one tends to happen if i hit enter in grub too fast .. like <=10 secs ....
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	HawkeV		swraid... dependable
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	vanberge		anybody can recommend a good front end to scp?  :-)
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	yeah I've heard it's faster than hardware RAID in most cases
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	yes ... src ...
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	bjames_		RAID 5 would be ideal
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	LameBMX	bjames_	fakeraid .. is a pain in the butt .. but it works too ... eventually
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	hexidigital	ok	one sec
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	HawkeV	bjames_	swraid 0 or 1 maybe
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	HawkeV		swraid anything else is neither fast or reliable
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	sukarn	Dicander	do you have all the repos enabled?
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	LameBMX		speakin of which how can i add to a wiki or whatever ?
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	well, it's obviously not, if you use decent hardware.. but it is a lot less expensive, and it can combine drives from any type of interface
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	bulmer		vanverge: on konqueror there is fish:///
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  first, make sure you have dependencies.. "sudo apt-get build-dep qt4-dev-tools
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	alecjw	LameBMX	sign up to thw wiki, and click on edit at he top of the page. to make a new page, go tho that page and click on "make new page"
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	the last one is really the most important - if you get, say, 4 drives on a 4-drive RAID card, then that's it - you cannot expand beyond it, and if you decide to put in another 4x card then you'd get 2 arrays at best - with softraid you just set up all 8 drives to give you RAID 10 or 5 or 50 or whatever
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	Dicander	sukarn	I tried that and got: The package is not available but another package refers to it. This package might replace it: libnspr-dev. Mozilla-dev has no release candidate (rough translation from the actual Swedish messages i got)
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	whether RAID5 is ideal really depends on what you're going to use it for
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  then extract the archive -- "tar zxvf {qt.tar.gz file name}, then ./configure, then sudo make, then sudo make install

2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	in terms of pure storage, yes - it is
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	HawkeV		if it worked, it would be slow
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  that *could* be a problem... not definitely, though
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	LameBMX		ahhh so i have to create a wiki account too
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	don't be silly - it's standard on 2.6 kernels
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	huhmm. how can i solve that ?!
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	you're on crack bro
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	HawkeV		2.6 supports natively, 0,1,3,5 and possibly 6
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	sukarn		can anyone help me with what I said a while ago? -

2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well I like RAID 5 as a balance between fault tolerance and speed, however thinking about it striping (RAID 1?) might be better as it'll be accedd over a wireless network therefore wont need the speed
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  you can try to ./configure it w/o downloading dependencies, and see what you need
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	HawkeV	sure	you can mirror then stripe two md's
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	bjames_		accessed*
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	it won't actually increase performance over raid-5 i software, since you'd have to run raid 0 on top of raid 1 , but it is certainly possible
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	HawkeV		but i've never seen it done
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	LameBMX		well all i was going to do is put how i used 2 wiki's to install fakeraid with dmraid in guimode .. but it used a non guimode for install lol
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	Dicander	sukarn	No I haven't enabled any non-default repos. How do I do that?
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	please stop talking out of your rear end :)
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	LameBMX		:/
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	heh
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	i already tryied it, but qt isn't installed correctly
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	do you have any life experience in a real environment with raid, or is this just what you read on google?
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	HawkeV		\
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I've read a bit about RAID and it seems simple enough to set up in Linux
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	i think that my qt is 3.x.x ... and after compiling it, it continues the same
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	sukarn	Dicander	the package is in the universe repositories
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	fotoflo_	hmm	
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  you can "sudo apt-cache search qt" *replace qt with any dependencies you need to find packages that match
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	HawkeV	because	given my own experience with RAID implementations in a server environment, i'd be forced to mock anyone who actually considered using swraid for anything that they wanted to be either reliable or reduntant
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	basically I want a VERY reliable box that I can sit in a cupboard and not worry too much about, but I'd like to be able to compile stuff with it every now and again
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	sukarn	Dicander	type in a terminal - gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	fotoflo_		so what needs to happen for a cgi to run on apache?
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	lemme try it, thx u very much !
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	fotoflo_	ive	chmod 555'ed the script
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	HawkeV	bjames_	buy yourself a cheap raid card from newegg
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	what do you mean by real life experience ? I run about 50 HP proliant servers with any thinkable combination of raid and hardware controllers, including a cluster setup with a fully redundant MSA1500 w/ 14x 72GB Ultra320 on fibre channel
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  hope it helps :)
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	fotoflo_		but i still get forbidden
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	sukarn	Dicander	then uncomment (remove #) the lines that say universe
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	Dicander	sukarn	Thanks. I'll try that
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	yes, md raid is very easy to set up - you can even let Ubuntu server do it for you while installing
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	bjames_		Hawkev: how cheap is cheap though?  I think software RAID is probably right for me
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	that's what I did - mine is running off 2x 36GB ultra160 on an adaptec card
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	HawkeV	adaptr	then you should well know that swraid doesn't fly in that environment
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	sukarn	Dicander	you'll need to do a "sudo apt-get update" before you can inatall mozilla-dev
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	adaptr	HawkeV	what environment ? what are you talking about ?
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	HawkeV	bjames_	a cheap card starts at $70
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	HawkeV	tho	I wouldn't vouch for exactly how reliable it would be
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	bjames_		you see that's not really "cheap" compared to what I'm looking at shelling out for the rest of the HW
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	if the choice is between Linux md RAID and a fakeraid card, forget the card - it's useless
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	HawkeV		you could pick up a 3ware 7500 for about 150
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	a *real* RAID controller will start at around $300, for 4 SATA channels
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	sukarn		does no one have any idea how to build a raid array? i'm not really sure what i have to do here. i'm using a single HDD, and mdadm is causing some problems
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	sukarn		i don't even know what RAID is
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	exactly!
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	HawkeV	sukarn	why do you want to build a raid array with a single hdd?
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	but that will also give you on-board cache RAM and battery backup - which is a little more than you need for  a home setup
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	sukarn		see my thread here - http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=326894
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I can get an SATA mobo for 30 (~$45) and software RAID a lot easier!
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	sukarn		i've explained everything there
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	lipe	hexidigital	hexi ... i need to compile it in a especific directory ??
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I thought you already had the board ? you mentioned a P3 450 somewhere back
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	alecjw	sukarn	RAID makes 2 hard drives act as one
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	hexidigital		lipe::  no... it'll find the directories it needs
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	fotoflo_		how do i get a cgi script to work in a apache?
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	bjames_		RAID = redundant array of inexpensive disks - it's a way to either make your storage FASTER, MORE RELIABLE or both
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	adaptr	fotoflo_	#apache
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	fotoflo_	ok	
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	HawkeV	sukarn	that error is normal
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	HawkeV		it's not detrimental to your system in anyway
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	LameBMX		okay here is my too quick of boot error ... drumroll pleeze .... http://img172.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dscf0016kz7.jpg
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	HawkeV		it's just starting the md drivers, and since you don't have raid, is flagging a warning
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		i have a problem to teach my edgy eft that my mouse has 12 buttons, not only 9
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	sukarn	ok	then i wonder why its causing so much CPU usage and HDD slowdown. it never appeared before, and i've not had such slow performance with such high CPU usage
2007-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	HawkeV	sukarn	you sure the slowdown is md related?
2007-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	here's the evolution of my fileserver - VMware setup to test (current), PIII 450 hardware (next step - when I get back to the flat), hardware X (when I get round to upgrading so I can use SATA HDDs possibly)
2007-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	good point; run dstat while doing disk-related things to see what causes the slowdown
2007-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	sukarn		i think it is, and the other guy in the thread also said he'd been having slow downs with the same warning.
2007-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	how much time between step 2 and 3 ? if it's less than say a month, it might not be worth the trouble
2007-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	sukarn	adaptr	i'll do that just now
2007-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	alecjw	HawkeV	try passing noapci as a kernel argument. if you fix it, you might want ot ad the arguments spash and quiet too, to get rid of that nasty text
2007-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	you may have to apt-get dstat first
2007-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	sukarn		$ dstat

2007-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	at the moment I'm a Windows user and want a file store with some provision to "play" with Linux
2007-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		i have a problem to teach my edgy eft that my mouse has 12 buttons, not only 9
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'll probably install a "minimal" X-install for now and use the PIII hardware with my current PATA drives
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	bjames_		thanks one and all for the info/advice
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	hexidigital		lord_ceiphas::  heh.. .i have a problem teaching dapper that i have 5 buttons :-P
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	if all you want is a fileserver, why use X at all ?
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		very funny.. i added the buttons in the xorg.conf, but when i run xmodmap he tells me, that there are only 9... if i look at my mouse, it HAS 12
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well this is something I'm arguing with myself, part of me wants a graphical logic from my Windows box so I can sort of ease myself into Linux (I've only ever dipped my toes in the Linux water and found it to be tepid at best, although it's getting warmer)
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	Dicander		Where do I find gsuko?
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	Dicander		What package?

2007-01-01T03:46:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	(I've tried VMware - which I love, I've also dual booted, but found the sheer number of partitions can be a hastle when windows dies and decides it wants to "reclaim" the HDD behind my back, etc)

2007-01-01T03:51:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I understand that, and for that, you can start by running Ubuntu in a vmware host to get used to it. But for a server, things are altogether completely different

2007-01-01T03:53:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	start from a graphical "Desktop" install?
2007-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	jbroome	adaptr	breezy isn't a LTS.  Dapper is, so far the only lts
2007-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	Dicander	sukarn	It still does not work. It says mozilla-dev has no release candidate.
2007-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	of course you can do that, but it will need significantly more hardware
2007-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	Terminus	bjames_	if you want to know what's useful to learn, i'd say learn how to use vi. it's probably the most generally available text editor on a linux box and you'll be using it extensively to edit configuration files.

2007-01-01T03:55:00.000Z	adaptr	alecjw	advising people to upgrade has very little to do with whether it's still supported, in  my view - Ubuntu is heavily under development, and even Dapper will have many advantages over breezy, whether breezy is EOL or not.

2007-01-01T03:59:00.000Z	alecjw	javimansilla	you can do the deb-src too, but unesss you're actually gonna use the sdources, it's rather pointless
2007-01-01T03:59:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	it should never *need* an array to just access hard drives

2007-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	but there could be BIOS options to switch the controller between normal mode and RAID mode

2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	Maheanuu		When Ubuntu first made it's debut, I watched in awe of its humanitarian goals and ideals...  I started handing out warty discs to everyone I ran into at home, and even made a convert of a nephew who was attending our university and working on a degree in puter science, today he is a linux guru and wouldn't change for anything...
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	koyo001		hello

2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	HawkeV	zOap	you didn't say it was for ftp, heh
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	HawkeV	afaik	ftp doesn't support recursive deletion
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	qos		my ubuntu hangs after "Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ... Done." Does anyone know a solution?
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	koyo001		not really clear how to do it\
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	HawkeV		you'll want to use a gui interface for it
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	HawkeV		but i could be wrong
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	no, I thought it would be the same.. but I was arrogantly wrong:D sorry..
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	LameBMX		but i did have a gentoo install a couple years ago from a nix buddy ... and last summer i made a vector linux aao server for a buddy

2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	HawkeV	lord_ceiphas	i know that, most graphical ftp clients do
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	stockfisch		can anyone tell me how i can start a "desktop icon" as super user? i want it to always ask me for the pwd when i double click it
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	hexidigital		koyo001::  type the letters "HEXI" then press TAB
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	HawkeV		i was saying i could be wrong about the ftp cli recursive deletion
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	zOap	lord_ceiphas	it does, but it freezes when it's supposed to delelte folders with alo of subfolders...
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	HawkeV		things may have changed since the last time i used ftp
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	HawkeV	zOap	it may not be 'frozen'
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	koyo001		hexi hello
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	HawkeV		if there are a lot of sub folders and files
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV		it has to go through ever folder
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	zOap	depends of the server
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV		catalogue whats there
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV		then delete every file/folder one by one
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	hexidigital		koyo001::  ok, close enought
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	koyo001		trying but not working
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	qos		my ubuntu hangs after "Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ... Done." Does anyone know why it does so?
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	well, I've tried on many servers, the same result...
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV		have you tried on a folder with one file in it?
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	koyo001	hexidigital	hello
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	hexidigital		koyo001::  there you go :)

2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV	right	then it's just taking time to find out what there is to delete

2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	koyo001	alecjw	gonna try that

2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	johns^	adaptr	don't forget swap :)

2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	chable		do i need those 8 mbuffer too ?
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	adaptr	chable	if you intend to experiment or add more linuxen later, set up a separate /boot of about 100MB
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	johns^	e\ectro_	install portmap
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	adaptr	johns^	swap ? who uses swap these days :)
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	e\ectro_	johns^	/etc/init.d/portmap ?
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	chable		so i dont need swap ?
2007-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	HawkeV		/etc/init.d/portmap restart
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	LDZ420		what is the file name that list the repositories for apt-get?
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	HawkeV		then remount

2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	e\ectro_		wow
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	johns^	e\ectro_	allready installed? then it could be some nameresolving issue
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	HawkeV		portmap isn't necessarily needed with nfs
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	klaus		does nobody know how to use autofs to work correctly ?
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	johns^	chable	you do need swap
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	HawkeV		it does speed things up tho
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	mnoir	adaptr	who uses swap?  Folks who do not want their system dieing unexpectedly due to a memory leak
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	e\ectro_	johns^	it was portmap, wasnt installed by default
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	johns^	e\ectro_	I know :)
2007-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	e\ectro_		I havent been impressed with the ubuntu 64 bit release though
2007-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	e\ectro_		its plagued with a few issues still, but 32 bit version just plain rox
2007-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	chable		i thought that
2007-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	chable	ok	
2007-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	chable		i will get out and install
2007-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	e\ectro_		64 bit on every distro is quirky though
2007-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	LDZ420	apt-get	list and someone send me a link on ubuntu's repository

2007-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	phr34ck		then I do: sudo apt-get upgrade, yes ?
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	phr34ck		or is it update?
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	matsyes	ummm	ikonia were u asking me????
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	ikonia		yes
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	unimatrix9		maybe there is an option in bios that will help, but i am not sure about that ( vaio )
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	ikonia		I missed your question
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	matsyes		oh ok
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	matsyes		just a sec
2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	matsyes		i have a vaio and i installed ubuntu edgy eft on it ..but the wierdest things happening ...it works fine when i connect the ac voltage but not when i start it from battery ..however if i start it using ac it works fine and then when i switch to battery it continues to run ...
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	unimatrix9		reading the viao bios pdf right now to see
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	sukarn		I disabled acpi apic support in BIOS, and then X would not start. nvidia seemed to be unable to fine a device.
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	matsyes	unimatrix9	i dont follow exactly
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	ikonia	matsyes	what works fine when you are using ac power ?
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	does it die or hangs at a precise moment?
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	mnoir	adaptr	I agree that you are free to not use swap.  before deciding not to take advantage of very cheap insurance, ya might want to google 'need swap in linux?'  and read some technical opinions  :)
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	matsyes	ubuntu	boots up properly
2007-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	matsyes		Jowi:hangs at that precise moment
2007-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	adaptr	mnoir	what technical opinions ? I never said I don't want or use swap.. boy you're easy to bait :)
2007-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	HawkeV		bll
2007-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	matsyes		are there any other details that i could provide ????
2007-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	when does it hang?
2007-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	matsyes		it does checks on the sda partitions (sata disc) and hangs when it marks sda6 has clean
2007-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	sukarn	adaptr	LameBMX - do you think I need to disable acpi apic support in BIOS?
2007-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	s6o	hi	somebody help me to change the f@#$%ing default runlevel please - ubuntu 6.10
2007-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	mnoir	adaptr	naa - just adding to the general discussion.  I am one of those old fashioned types who prises reliability and, therefore, uses swap, anti virus, multiple firewalls, etc.  Of course - the icestorm poweroutage just got me anyway :)
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	jasin		hi
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	to achieve what ?
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	matsyes		when i did the recovery mode it once gave me a graphical prob
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	and this only when booting on battery?
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	matsyes		but with ac power theres no prob
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	sukarn		you forgot the raid discussion we were having a while ago?
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	s6o		i am going nuts here since tehre's no /etc/inittab
2007-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	matsyes		yup only with battery

2007-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	is the sata drive internal or external?

2007-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	sukarn	adaptr	a while ago someone said that i should not have raid enabled in BIOS
2007-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	Maheanuu	sukarn	I disabled it on mine, and haven't had a hang since
2007-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	jasin	kemik	huh?
2007-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	matsyes		jowi:sata drive is internal

2007-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	sukarn	maheanuu	but x fails to start when I disable acpi apic support
2007-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	jasin	Maheanuu	you disabled acpi?
2007-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	that should make no difference .. is you set the controller to pata mode you will have them appear to be ide drives .. hda instead of sda
2007-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	Maheanuu	jasin	yes
2007-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	mnoir	LameBMX	does that change performance?
2007-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	jasin		I have had lots of trouble with acpi apic apm too
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	LameBMX	dk	
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	that depends on what you want to do, and whether the RAID controller is supported well (or at all) in the Linux kernel
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	LameBMX		i know the standard is susposed to be a max of 6 ide devices
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	jasin		I wish someone would post a acpi bug report on launchpad
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	if it is not well supported then you definitely want to get it out of the way, yes
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	matsyes		when i do recovery boot ..then i have no probs it comes to the command prompt
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	LameBMX		so it could limit (windows standard from A+ junk)
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	donald		anyone familiar with libdvdread errors?
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	yeah ive debugged those before
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		how do i enable the virtual consoles tty1-tty6?
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	phr34ck		From where I can download codecs for Ubuntu ?
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	jasin	donald	not me, sorry.
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	donald	k	im getting this:  Zero check failed in ifo_read.c

2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	mnoir	lord_ceiphas	they should be there already
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		so that if i hit ctrl-alt-f1 i get a console?
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	jbroome	lord_ceiphas	control alt F1 through F6
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	uhhh u need DeCSS
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	phr34ck		I need codecs to play .mpg .mpeg and the like.
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	sukarn	adaptr	then i have to figure out how to get x working without acpi apic in BIOS
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	phr34ck		!codecs

2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	i got it. twice, 2 diff versions and same thing
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	jasin		.c is a source code, something programed in the c programing language
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		brings up a black screen with one single corsor-line in the middle
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	at the grub boot screen ...
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	try rebooting?  i dont know why it is is needed but that fixed it for me
2007-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	LameBMX		hit f6 ( or e if its installed)
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	xtknight		probably restarts some service that i dont know the name of
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	sukarn	adaptr	i tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-glx linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` linux-image-`uname -r`, but that didn't work
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	LameBMX		and add noapic nolapic to the string
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	the error happens in mplayer, dvd-rip, vobcopy, dvdbackup, but not in gxine, where dvd playback is perfect
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	unimatrix9	matsyes	there are two things you could try ( later , if no one gives you an better advice ) first boot from the ubuntu install cdrom, its also an live cd, see if it hangs too on battery mode , second boot the vaio, press F2 you go into your bios, be carefull what you do here, go to Boot, and make sure the boot from usb is not as first boot device...
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	is this installed or livecd
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	jasin		I had big time trouble with acpi and apm in kde, I now use gnome.
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	sure xgine uses libdvdread?
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	jbroome	mnoir: this only brings up a black screen
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	i have restarted about 10 times in the 2 days ive had this problem
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	"didn't work" tells me nothing
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	that is strange indeed. normally a laptop can hang during boot if it does not get enough juice from the battery. this usually happen when the drives/cd/dvd spins up and there is a power spike. it seems, from your description, to be the case, however it only happen on the drive check on an internal sata which doesn't need much power. I would suggest that you skip the drivecheck when on battery. don't know if you got yourself a b
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Jowi		ad battery or not.
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	mnoir	lord_ceiphas	for all 1-6?
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	mnoir	yes
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	which one? the initrd line or the one before that? its installed
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	mnoir		what happens when you press return?
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	i assume so. or does xine have something that does it?
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	sukarn	adaptr	I mean i still could not start x after a reboot
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	mnoir	if i do this often, my x-xerver crashes
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	LameBMX		no the grub screen
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	matsyes	ok	unimatrix9 i'll try it
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	jasin		It would detect the laptop lid is closed when its not and the system was set to shut down when laptop lid is closed, I could never stay in kde.
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	LameBMX		when you select your boot type .. hit e
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	mnoir	lord_ceiphas	hmm - odd
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	jasin		very frustrating
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	try running gxine from the terminal, it should print to output and give you some clues as to what libraries its using
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	LameBMX		goto second line .. the long one with hernal and junk
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	mnoir	if i hit return, i go to a new blank line (the cursor moves down)
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	wait gxine does, because is till get this: libdvdread: CHECK_VALUE failed in ifo_read.c but no crash
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	ok, thanks. i'll try that now
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	LameBMX		where you can remove quiet and splash ... put noapic and nolapic
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	LameBMX		good luck
2007-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	bye
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	do you have any external devices connected? if so try to disconnect them to see if that helps
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	thats where im getting my output, ive been running everything in terminal
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	adaptr	sukarn	waay to coarse-grained.. you need to start doing steps one at a time, verify them, and see if they correspond to expected results
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	mnoir		if you go to a terminal and type ps auxwww|grep tty    what do you get - anything?
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	LameBMX		that hasnt helped my boot issues though lol
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	does the whole dvd play without issue or does just the first part work?  cuz i got that error and only the very first portion would play in SOME players, and in those few players it has then crashed so in effect nothing worked
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	jasin	yeah	you can do the noapic in grub.lst
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	matsyes	jowi	i infact thought its a bad battery and therefore charged it fully and then tried it no change
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		maybe it has something to do with my self-build kernel and nvidia-module, but with the bad 2.6.17 linux wont run on my system (ever heard of the famous jmicron-bug)
2007-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	LameBMX		yea .. might as well test first .. if it works change grub.lst
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	matsyes	jowi	i disconected all external drives
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	jasin		when I complie kernel 2.6.19.1 I get a acpi error message from grub.
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	mnoir	lord_ceiphas	maybe - i forgot where ttys are configged
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	in gxine the whole thing plays. but in mplayer only the intro before it freezes, then with vobcopy and dvdbackup, it only copies the first 15mb of the file before freezing, same error
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	jasin		I wont try compiling that kernel again
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	mnoir	in the character devices-menu there is no tty
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	unimatrix9		maybe some one could tell matsyes how to boot with kernel options on battery like no apic, or no acpi ( i kind of forgot how to )
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	mnoir	hmm	
2007-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	i checked the files vobcopy and dvdbackup made, and they stop only a LITTLE bit further than mplayer got
2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Jowi	matsyes	can still be bad even when fully charged if it does not provide enough output to power your drive during check. i suspect this since it works on AC
2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	hmm, i dont know.  i eventually got mine to operate after continuously googling, unfortunately that's all i can suggest.  i dont remember if my error was the same though
2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	mnoir		but xterms work?
2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	mnoir	maybe ill try the 2.6.18 again... that major bug should be corrected there, too
2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Jowi		!laptop-mode

2007-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	unimatrix9		if on ac, you can also check the battery state with ubuntu

2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	i heard that was one fix , but i didnt have to disable my usb.  i had to install from a usb cdrom
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	another thing: when i run vobcopy or dvdbackup, it will copy the entire 695mb menu file, but freezes at 15mb when it gets to the feature: VTS_01_1.VOB

2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	no errors at the beginning as far as i can tell. ive seen other people complain on forums but no solutions. so it may be a bug, or this particular dvd.
2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	paste the whole error output into pastebin, ill see if i recognize any of the errors, i recall getting the ifo_read one but also another and i cant remember which one i was able to fix
2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	mnoir	phr34ck	sounds like something is running away - use top to see

2007-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	so have u gotten ubuntu installed?  dapper/edgy?  hows its it working on the C2d?
2007-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	maybe a core2duo with a jmicron-chipset?
2007-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	matsyes	ok	thanks a lot for ur time and help though really appreciate the effort i'll have a go and give it a try
2007-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	phr34ck		but why is it running

2007-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	Jowi	Rope	"sudo fdisk -l"  should give you an idea. hd0,0 is /dev/hda1 and hd0,2 is /dev/hda3
2007-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	xtknight	works fine... just running it, but to get your usb back you have to make your own kernel... and thats a bit ugly here atm
2007-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	unimatrix9		good luck matsyes

2007-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	Rope	Jowi	Thanks
2007-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	realy? is there some c2d usb patch or something?

2007-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	jannu1		any idea how i can remove shortcuts (link to folder) at my desktop?
2007-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	is a jmicron-controller on this board? if yes try to disable usb for installing
2007-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	jasin		you can get it off of synaptics or with apt-get
2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	matsyes		and thanks jowi

2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	Core		it's so confusing
2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	xtknight	no the fix was made in 2.6.28 kernel as long as you use a higher kernel, you can use your usb, blew makes problems
2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	floppyears		does anybody here know how can I hook up a mac book pro laptop and an ubuntu machine over an ethernet cable to share files ?

2007-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		thats the cause the ubuntu-users with new boards are so angry because nobody just upgrades ubuntu /kubuntu.. to 2.6.18 and you have to be good to get this working

2007-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	could it be the a52 format?

2007-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Maheanuu	without the 2.6.18 kernel linux is not very handsome for c2d-board... many bugs
2007-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	Francis_Albert		how are you ?
2007-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	i think it's just saying that because a52 is trying to decode corrupted info
2007-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	Francis_Albert		Please?
2007-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	jasin		If you are ussing legacy use support in the bios it can create problems, its a well documented issue.

2007-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	jasin	with c2d-boards you often have to disable usb completely (but only for kernel 2.6.17 and below
2007-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	xtknight		well i needed legacy usb support for my usb cdrom yet it worked fine for me, i dont know

2007-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		and ubuntu is delivered with kernel 2.6.17 what makes it nearly impossible for newbies (ubuntu is the distro made for them) to get it running....
2007-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	floppyears		anybody who can help me with my ubuntu and mac question ?
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	apokryphos		!anyone
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	ubotu		A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		at least if the newbies have a core2duo
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	jannu1		no prob anymore
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	jasin	uname	-a gives you more info, like if the kernel is 386 or 686 and when it was installed
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	jasin	who cares ;-)
2007-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	xtknight	jasin	i believe it says when the kernel was compiled
2007-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	e\ectro_		for some reason my nvidia card booted into X windows but the screen is black

2007-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	BrianB04		I have a quick x.org question, but since I run Ubuntu, figured I would ask in here: How painless is it to setup widescreen monitors in Ubuntus x.org?

2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	BrianB04	xtknight	So you just have to set it up as another resolution and it will work? I didn't know how well x.org handles 'non-standard' resolutions
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	emacla		How do i create a dir with the terminal?
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Lynoure	wvrlinux	What is JASS? (Other than Journal of Applied Systems Studies)
2007-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	xtknight		Brianb04: pretty much so, i think even vesa will allow 1680x1050, but i use the nvidia driver personally and it works great

2007-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	BrianB04	xtknight	Very cool. I'm looking at 19 inchers, so 1280x...900 I think would be native.
2007-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	Anderson		Anyone have any advice on touchscreen setup?
2007-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	xtknight		brainb04: 1440x900 19" widescreen?

2007-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	mnoir		core - is Kurumim a full distrib or just KDE?
2007-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	BrianB04	xtknight	That's it, nevermind:)
2007-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	xtknight	brianb04	do u have nvidia/fglrx drivers or are you using default nv/radeon/ati/vesa now?

2007-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	BrianB04	lord_ceiphas	Because to get 1600x1200 I have to hit at least 20 inch lcds, and those get...costly:) I have a 21 inch crt right now and run 16x12

2007-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	Core		no one works
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	xtknight		brainb04: yeah, well try `sudo nvidia-xconfig` and let it overwrite your current xorg config.  that always lets me use the native resolution after restarting gdm ( `sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart` )
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	BrianG	i have 1600x1200 on a 19"
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	lardarse		ok.. does anyone here know where the best place to look is for info about Joysticks in Ubuntu ?
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	mnoir	Core	so you are asking about it in an ubuntu support group - isn't that a little off topic?
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	BrianB04	lord_ceiphas	What brand of monitor? I couldn't find a 19" lcd with 16x12 native.
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	crt though, right?
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	no better than having one that doesn't work, then
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	xtknight		lcds do not exist at 1600x1200 <20"
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	that has to do with the kernel... 2.6.17 or belo wont work on core2duo boards
2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	Core		I'll explain for all what's happening
2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		of course crt....
2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	Core		so listen
2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	BrianB04		I figure that 19" lcd is close enough to the size of a 21" crt and I hate this huge monitor, takes up too much room, and creates too much heat.

2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	the kernel is the heart of linux, and the kernel with the number "2.6.17" will not run on core2duo mainboards so you have to get a linux with kernel 2.6.18 or higher
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Core		I have debian

2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Anderson		Is there anyone to figure out the Manufacture, and thereby the drivers needed, for my LCD screen?
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Core	lord_ceiphas	but the kernel of Ubuntu 6.06 is 2.6.17?

2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	ubotu	Ubuntu	6.10 (Edgy Eft) is the latest version of Ubuntu. Upgrading to Edgy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades - Downloading: http://www.ubuntu.com/download - Release Notes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EdgyReleaseNotes
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	adaptr	amicrawler	gksu "update-manager -c" and click on "upgrade"....
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	Core	lord_ceiphas	adaptr, 2.6.15-27
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	amicrawler		i hvae the dvd in my drive now
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	adaptr	amicrawler	it's been running here for the last 2 hours or so.. expect a bit of a wait :)
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	mnoir	amicrawler	go to that link and follow nice directions
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	you will never get a linux running on a core2duo-board if you use a linux with kernel 2.6.17 or lower... so go and find a distro that HAS a higher kernel shipped
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	i just tried mplayer starting on a chapter other than chapter 1 and playback is perfect. im guessing its some kind of copy protection on chapter 1 of the dvd.
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	I know - I told you, and that's what I have running
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	Core	lord_ceiphas	sorru! I was confused with what adaptr saidx
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	Core	lord_ceiphas	I'll believe you
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	and Edgy has 2.6.17, so you'll have to take a look at Feisty
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	Core	lord_ceiphas	I thought the problem was SATA, but is C2D...
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	fotoflo_		hey does anyone know how i set my default mp3 player in ubuntu?
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	or disable usb for installing and get youselv a new kernel compiled after instzallation (that was my way)
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	adaptr	fotoflo_	right-click on an mp3 file, choose properties.. and select open with.. then select a new default
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	xtknight		i have some core 2 duo kernels here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=326343
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	it is not SATA and also not C2D its the JMICRON-PATA controller on your board
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	jasin	foto	just because you dont know how to do playlist in vlc does not mean it wont do playlist

2007-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	Core		the installation will proceed???
2007-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	i got playback to work on chapters other than chapter 1

2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	yes
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	xtknight	donald	i can't remember what i did to fix it.  but the document on restricted formats on ubuntu wiki + a reboot did it for me.  32bit or 64bit?
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	fotoflo_		cool that worked
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	donald	xtknight	64bit processor, but 32bit ubuntu
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	amicrawler	xknight	
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	release names, actually - dapper was 6.06 (june 2006), edgy is current, 6.10 (october), feisty is next, due out in april or something
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	Maheanuu	lord_ceiphas	I am running 2.6.15-26-AMD64 generic

2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	Core		and boot options on the CD prompt? No one? Coz there is something regarding USB detection...
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	jasin	vlc	supports .pls and .m3u play lists.
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	Core	try to disable usb in bios, so maybe the installation will work (it did for me
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	amicrawler		can i upgrade my sys to edgy from the dvd i downloaded?
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	youll have to wait til u get net til u can install mp3 support i think
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	amicrawler		and save my home dir

2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	so 6.10 doesn't works yet???
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	floating		how to extract .ace ?
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	adaptr	amicrawler	don;'t need either - just an Internet connection
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	of course it works - what do you mean ?
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	i have to wait the next release?
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	well, like I said, you can try Feisty now - but it is on serious beta
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	amicrawler		<floating> how to extract .ace ?   do a unace
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	or try one of xtknight's kernels, if you;ve been paying attention at all
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	BrianB04	Cool	alright back in business
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	lord_ceiphas said kernel 2.6.17 doesn't works with JMICRON-PATA
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	floating		how to do an unace? unace command not found
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	confused...so is downloading a couple debs feasible for you at the moment?
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	you can download debs at packages.ubuntu.com and install them later
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	Core		and 6.10 has this kernel? right? or higher?
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	yeah I bought aportable harddrive the other day
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	core	i have kubuntu edgy eft (6.10) running on my c2d-system, just disable usb for installing, make a text-install of ubuntu, afterwards get a new kernel and if this kernel runs, enable usb again
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	no he did not - he said repeatedly that 2.6.17 does not work with the core 2 duo
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	but everytime i try to install something it tries to go to the internet to find stuff
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	and 6.10 has this kernel? right? or higher?
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	adaptr	i sais JMICRON
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	dapper and edgy do not work properly with jmicron, u must use feisty or fedora core 6 or opensuse 10.2 or find an alternate way of booting dapper since edgy doesnt work with ich8 either
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	adaptr	lord_ceiphas	well, that's very confusing then
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	BrianB04	Core	Feisty Fawn will have the newer kernel, Edgy does not.
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		or c2d-BOARD, because this pata-controller is on nearly EVERY c2d-board
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	what other installation media do u have
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	?\
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	other than internet?  how else would it install things?
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	do u have an ubuntu cd, or dvd?
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	I have the image burned on a cd
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	im afraid xmms isnt on the cd by default so it must go to the internet
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	jasin		kind of off topic but did any see that stuff about that broncos player? so sad
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	nn531	ok	
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	what broncos player??
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	so edgy doesn't works in no way but dapper that is older do?
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	whats the ubuntu site to download the dap files?
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	xtknight	core	that was the case for me.  but to boot dapper i had to use a usb-cdrom drive instead of my dvd drives hooked up to the jmicron as they would not be detected
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	Core		--- All People --- : let me see if i undertood
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	nn531		deb imean

2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	i thought a dap package meant u wanted one for dapper ;)
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	nn531		no im sorry
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	Core		or find an alternative customized kernel for 6.06 and 6.10
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		yes for easy way you have to wait
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	nn531		i got deb confused with dap
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	Core		--- All People ---: or find an alternative customized kernel for 6.06 and 6.10

2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	Core		--- All People ---: and to do that I have to install 6.06 and update its kernel
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	jasin		you must mount sda1 first
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	nn531	mnoir	i'd say
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	yes
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Core		--- All People ---: but to do it I ghave to disable USB on BIOS
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	yes,thats why i cant resize it
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	in some cases.  i did not have to.
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	do you have a copy of knoppix?
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Anderson		Does ubuntu still support xFree86?

2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	yes, u may also have to download dependencies for those if needed, but it should only amount to about 5 packages total at most just for xmms and xmms-mad...i think

2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	no, u cannot resize a mounted partition, but to have your root partition not mounted you need to be booting off a cd, knoppix im sure has a partition editor, and im sure that ubuntu doesnt
2007-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	uhhhh do sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-desktop
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lumaQQ		when i drag a file into the /usr/share  folder is just dont drop there?  is that cos i need to log in as root first?? (^-^)?
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		i have kubuntu, but thanks, ill try that
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	jasin		you do a rescue in recovery mode, use fsck
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	the second option? the same happens
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	should restore basic functionality, /usr shouldnt usually contain too much personal stuff that shuold be in /home
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	try kubuntu-desktop then
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	so i can only do it from live cd?
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	mnoir	lumaQQ	or run nautilus in superuser mode
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	Anderson		what command do I use to check and modify user privileges?
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lumaQQ	mnoir	how do i do that?
2007-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	then press "e" to edit the boot options, scroll to the kernel line, add "single" on the end, and press "b" to boot
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	u were talking to me?
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	MasterShrek		i believe so, unless you have another os on that you can boot to so that your partition isnt mounted
2007-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	mnoir	lumaQQ	1 way: in terminal: gksudo nautilus

2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	I dont understand why rhythmbox wont work, why would they even put it on there to begin with?
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	sure, if you like
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	the help of menu does not works fully
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	it's illegal to have mp3 support in by default
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	cant i use fdisk?
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	IdleOne		Happy New Year All! what is the command to reconfigure xorg? least I believe thats what I need to dio because everything on my screen is way to big
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	sorry, that doesn't parse
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	due to copyright laws i think, or something like that, but no linux distro can include it
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	some Fx keys does not work
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	jasin	mp3	is not illegal, pirating is.
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	maybe, can u resize using fdisk, ive never done it
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	explain "too big"
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	thanks guy
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	i see, just another microsoft thing huh?

2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	i'll do that
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	i guess....i think microsoft pays fraunhofer iis for permission to use mp3
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	if u can, then yes, but u just have to boot the live cd so your partition isnt mounted
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	adaptr	my icons on desktop are about 2 times the size of what they were yesterday morning

2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	BrianB04	nn531	What, MP3 not being included? Now that's a Fraunhofer thing.
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	like I told you, install vlc it'll do mp3 playback
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	how does this relate to your screen resolution, i.e. what is it ?

2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	ubotu	IdleOne	To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Anderson		how do i list all available user accounts?
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	hold on let me bringit up again
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	samyboy	Hello	. sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales does not give me a menu to configure my locales. how to get it ?
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	in terminal 'cat /etc/passwd
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	then something has screwed up your xorg config - you can force a reconfig by running "sudo Xorg -configure" from a console, but it won't be perfect
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	MasterShrek		hey does anyone know where i can get w32codecs at?

2007-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	there is an admin function in gnome as well
2007-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	it wont let me view the entire page, I get to "For a normal install, do:" then I cant go down anyfurther
2007-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	use the instructions listed on the vlc ubuntu page not the debian, http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ubuntu.html

2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	k, I was wondering why you gave me the debian page
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	well, try one or the other ways of reconfiguring your xorg.conf first, then see what it puts in the config file
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	jjlee		I just did a sudo aptitude purge mysql-server , but I still have mysqld and /etc/init.d scripts and /etc/rc.d symlinks -- anybody have a clue?

2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	for any control over screen resolutions and refresh, you'll have to hand-edit xorg.conf anyway
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	the instructions are this: 1. sudo apt-get update 2. sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-esd 3. sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2

2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	Yea, I removed that trying to fix something. I forgot about it though. I'll put it back on and see if that helps.

2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	anyway - the /etc files are all viewable :)
2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	well you'll have to go online to install mp3 support, there is no mp3 support natively
2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	nn531		k
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	vlc is just onhe player that supports mp3

2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	vlc is just one player that supports mp3
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	I did manage to install libdvdcss2 whatever
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	one of many
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	I'm trying to figure out why sudo is not working for my user account who is supposed to have admin privileges
2007-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	how? you said you were not online

2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	jasin		stormx, if they have the libraries installed, yes.
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	I'll check
2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	jasin	Incorrect.
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	pref is for the admin group as it is simple
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	jasin		stromx, umm no, you need the mp3 library to playback mp3s
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	jasin		stromx, no way around that
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	jasin	BMP, BMPx and Audacious support MP3 playback in-the-box
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	sudoers allows finer control
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	Akuma_		is it possible to grant an application permanent access to the keyring?
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	i'll wait till I have my wireless later tonight
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	& xtknight: thanks alot

2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	jasin		stormx2, and those are not installed by default are they? Like i originally said, he will have to download a media player that supports mp3 playback
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	adaptr	Music_Shuffle thanks for your help screen back to normal now :)

2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	Akuma_	amicrawler	i think if you get the torrent on ubuntu's website its a cd iso

2007-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	When I look in the groups file I see root:X:0:(no users listed)    and further down I see my user's group and the user in his own group.
2007-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	amicrawler		i downloaded the dvd iso and made it  know i need to know howto upgrade with out mess up my home dir with this dvd
2007-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	jasin	Right. But what you were saying is that you need certain libraries for mp3 playback in any media player. Thats wrong. The libraries for gstreamer to understand MP3 are not installed by default, but a lot of players don't have a gstreamer backend
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	but no admin:x:somenumber:users?
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	and no one under group adm or admin
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	wvrlinux	what is play jass? I've checked the repos, its not there
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	wvrlinux		stormx: Jass is a card game
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	styrange - i hesitate to tell you to manually add it
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	mnoir		but....
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	Storkme	err...don't you need the LAME libs? ./Could just be confused.
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	mnoir		is admin defined in yout sudoers file?
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	mnoir		yout=your :)
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	What interests me though, is that when I use the GUI users-admin, the user is a member of the group 'root'
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	adaptr	mnoir	Anderson: I am a member of both adm and admin, they should definitely be in there
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	adaptr	Anderson	which version are you on ?
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	amicrawler		i downloaded the dvd iso and made it  now i need to know. howto upgrade with out mess up my home dir with this dvd. is there a how to for this ?

2007-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	I had this hard drive installed in another system when I installed Ubuntu.
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	I moved it to this system and have been trying to adapt it since.
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	the value of what you are doing is a possible unnecessary education :)
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	Well, I haven't brought many issues here, mostly my touchscreen and touchpad.
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	mnoir		but carry on!
2007-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	it's education =] 
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	adaptr	amicrawler	if you did not alter the original list the dapper CD is still in there.. just replace it with somehting that looks right for the edgy dvd
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	mnoir	ok	- so eith that addition, sudo should work
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	timo901		eakr:well ??
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	adaptr	amicrawler	it has to be mounted first, and you'll have to do that
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	mnoir		eith=with
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	amicrawler	ok	goto it
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	I have learned that other people have had similar issues with their touchpad. It's a strange problem too.
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	amicrawler		in my src list
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	Yea, that worked.
2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	amicrawler		now do i do a upgrade
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	i hate my touch pad but the laptop is a second system for me
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	auTONYmous		touchscreen is a tough one....
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	well I have a touchscreen too, but that is in worse working order than the touchpad
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	and ssh-X puts it's windows on my desktop anyway :)
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	timo901	eakr	sudo fdisk -l
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	I got here late...what's the issue with the touchpad
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	Anderson		I have found one set of drivers, Accelerated-X, that reportedly work GREAT with my laptop. But they aren't free.
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	auTONYmous	timo901	he got banned for language...
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	the touchpad does a region select on the desktop instead of moving the cursor.
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	nivekz	hello	. here is a beginner's question. why can't input method be enabled in firefox by right click?
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	As if it were double clicking a place on the desktop that corresponded to the place I touch on the touchpad.
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	do you know the touchpad manufacturer and model # (Synaptics or otherwise)
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	timo901		:)thnks for telling me , he thou i had done some thing stupid with his hard drive? like wipe it clean
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	mnoir	Anderson	my touchpad works fine in 6.10 - would you like to see the definition?
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	No, I've been looking, but haven't figured out how to find it out. There are no system specs with that information online either.
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	dmesg should tell you...
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	Anderson	mnoir	Sure.
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	sweet, is that all of the devices on my system?
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	auTONYmous		whatever got loaded at startup...if not, then /var/log/Xorg.log will tell what driver its using
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	auTONYmous	lspci	shows all the devices
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	timo901		how do i use wine to play my game /media/window/GTR2:-P
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	I've tried lspci to find the touchpad and the monitor, the closest I have come is the display adapter.

2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		you can't do that in Kubuntu, at least that i've found, but Xubuntu/Ubuntu does it.
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	tomplast		a restart of gaim fixed my problems :)

2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	max_	another thing that may work, is find the icon file on your PC, open it with GIMP and use the resize function to resize the icon, then save, then change the icon using right click/properties

2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	well, then, what can I do? the drivers is the latest from ubuntu repository (and they told me here last night that Intel released GPL theirs drivers, so the ubuntu repository version is, in a way, official drivers)

2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	another suggestion?
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	yeah i do :P  you'll have to try a newer distro with the 2.6.18 kernel.  dapper or edgy will not work
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	vleon		i play games, download big files (sometimes more than 4 gb)
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	mwe		!release

2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	what case do i fit in? "Intel driver for X.org", "DRM kernel module" or "Mesa 3D GL driver"? I'm on this page: http://www.intellinuxgraphics.org/download.html
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	vleon		the xubuntu comp have the same porpuses but its a p3
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	if i could at least install something and then get the kernel
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	auTONYmous	avista	I'm having the same prob with Samba against a Vista box...no ideas yet
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	what's the size of your kernels?
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		i think PC's are finally getting to fast
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	adaptr	Marelo	mesa is horrid - it's a software GL renderer
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	xtknight	marelo	Mesa 3D GL driver i think
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756		is it possible to use lightscribe in ubuntu?
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	xtknight	marelo	no i take that back
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	auTONYmous	linuxnewbie756	Yep
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i'm on a dialed conn

2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	vleon		about the same topic, amule doesnt want to download big files, im using an ext3, is it an amule problem or a filesystem one?
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	xtknight	marelo	x.org 2d driver maybe? i dont know if intel even has accelerated 3d
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	the funny thin is:
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	adaptr	vleon	amule
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	auTONYmous	linuxnewbie756	I forget which (nerolinux, gnomebaker or otherwise), but one of the burning programs supports it
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	mwe	xtknight	it does
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	my Kurumim DO works
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	vleon		great thanx
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	LinTux		I have installed the core KDE desktop, it does not have a screen resolution setting, what elso do i need to install to get this in terminal?
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	adaptr	xtknight	accelerated Intel video is supported through the DRI interface of xorg
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	vleon		then i should use ext 4 for both my os?
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	it just don't recognize SATA :(
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	LinTux	soory
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	mwe	xtknight	the i8xx-i9xx do have accelerated 3d at least
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	LinTux	what do you mean?
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Core	LinTux	i'm in trouble too
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Marelo	mwe	nice to hear
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756		autonymous, i have a hp drive, and before you can actually use that software, you have to download somesort of lightscribe software, and off the lightscribe.com website, only rpm is supported
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Marelo		what could i do in that case, then?
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	skarface		can anyone tell me why gnome might be ignoring my session startup and the shortcut keys no longer work?
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Core	LinTux	with C2D
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	LinTux		i cannot alter the screen res in control centre, do I need to install another prog to get it
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and a very old version
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	auTONYmous	linuxnewbie756	man alien
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	vleon		then i should use ext 4 for both my os?
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	it detected both cores
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	uhh, my 2.6.19 kernel ( here http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=326343 ) is roughly 25 megs total
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	mwe		!fixres | LinTux
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	ubotu	LinTux	The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	linuxnewbie756		but is that safe? has anyone verified it works for lightscribe?
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	vleon	nevermind	
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	linuxnewbie756	alien will (possibly) allow you convert the RPM to a .deb
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	LinTux		I tried that UBOTU
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	vleon		thanks for the help :)!
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	linuxnewbie756	Then you can install on Ubuntu
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	that should be what 2 hours on dialup?  But it may be worth it...but u still can not boot dapper or edgy by the way
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	25MB at 5KB/s...
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	mwe		installing random converted rpms is not a good idea in general unles it's impossible to find a .deb for ubuntu
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	auTONYmous	mwe	In his case, it probably is impossible
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	deathplanter		i got no sound on ubuntu using xserver tools,although mpg321 is able to play mp3s and i can hear them. what could be wrong?
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	HymnToLife		and even so, installing from source is usually safer
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	Cypher		can any one tell where i can find online lpi exam
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	jasin		hi
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	n2diy	Cypher	Google?
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	yeah
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	mwe		yeah if the source code is available installing from source is a lot safer
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	maul555		woot.. it worked
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Cypher		hi man
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Cypher		i did
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	1,5 h
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	skarface	deathplanter	check your PCI volume
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Cypher		i just want to scale my self
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	maul555		needless to say it was user error,....
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	skarface		can anyone tell me why gnome might be ignoring my session startup and the shortcut keys no longer work?
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i'm thinkig a way to install this kernel from Kurumim
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	jasin		why is installing from a package unsafe?
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	deathplanter	skarface	it's all set to max
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	but that kernel is only useful if you already have linux installed
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	yeah
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	mnoir	Cypher	just a theory: google 'online lpi exam'
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	...
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	jasin		.deb just contain source code
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Cypher		let me check
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	jasin		their easy ti peerk inside of
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	jasin		to*
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	another way is to update Kurumim on the RAM!
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	.debs don't contain source code.
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	ahh ok, hope it works
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Cypher	mnoir	thnx
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	they contain binary code
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	dustigroove		http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/lpi/index.html
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	so that it recognizes SATA
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	xtknight	mwe	debs can contain source sometimes
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	dustigroove		lpi prep info on ibm's website
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	sorry
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	mnoir	jasin	the deb pkgs do not contain src, only the deb-src repos do
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	mwe	xtknight	yeah source .debs
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	psynaps3	Hi	can someone please tell me the shortcut key to check the cube effect in compiz? I have GL desktop enabled. Ctrl+Alt+L/R arrow doesn't seem to be working.
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Cypher		can i take it online
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	deathplanter	skarface	http://img358.imageshack.us/img358/8437/zrzutekranuxg2.png what could that mean?
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Core		People, Ubuntu does not works with C2D
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	deathplanter	psynaps3	so you got no compiz on ;p
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	mwe	xtknight	the things you install with apt-get don't contain source code unless you specifically ask for it
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	IcedEarth	psynaps3	make sure the 3D cube desktop is enabled
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	IcedEarth		in the beryl settings
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Core		That Ugly!
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	what could i do in that case, then? am I doomed to not play UT in linux? :(
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	jasin	Debian	packages are standard Unix ar archives
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	xtknight	mwe	yeah i believe you can get the source with apt-get source
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	psynaps3	IcedEarth	where do i check that?
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Core		And Windows XP?
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	skarface	deathplanter	don't know. you have no mixer options?
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	mwe	xtknight	right
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	jasin		I know what debian packages are
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	psynaps3	deathplanter	i have the wobbly effect working fine :)
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	xtknight	mwe	but correct the source is not in the regular debs, just that some people to put the source in debs (not debian or ubuntu maintainers though)
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	but you said they're just source which is not correct
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	l33t		join #ubuntu-xgl

2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	psynaps3	IcedEarth	I am using Compiz, not Beryl
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	i am really not sure, sorry.  consider getting a discrete 3D graphics card
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	IcedEarth		ah
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	IcedEarth		cant help you then

2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	skarface	deathplanter	right... well I guess you could try reinstalling alsa or something
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	mwe	xtknight	that's my point. .debs are not just source code though source .debs contain source code

2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	dustigroove		out of curiosity, is there a way i might be missing to use safe graphics mode from the 6.10 alternate install cd? i want to enable the vesa driver by default (autodetect uses ati) and am performign a custom installation (ie - don't want to use the live cd)
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	mwe	Core	repeating will get you kicked, likely
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	skarface	deathplanter	right... well I guess you could try reinstalling alsa or something
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	skarface		oops
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	xtknight		dustrigroove: i believe safe graphics mode is broken on edgy
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Core	mwe	sorry
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	plenty of people have the problem, not just you
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	sigh... but at the store i bought it, there were customers opinios saying that they played several games just fine... game still newer than UT.
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	dustigroove		thanks
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	ok, intel i915 correct?
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	jasin		libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb contains source code, its under the compressed file inside data.tar.gz
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	actually i used to play UT in a 16 mb video card, win 98, with 128 ram
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	yeah, that's right
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	so there's nothing more I can do here beyound you told me?
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	progek		can someone help me print with gvim? When I attempt it I get: E365 Failed to print PostScript file... I can't find the with google either.
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	jasin		a lot of debian packages do contain source code
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	you will have to install fedora core 6 or opensuse 10.2, no current Ubuntu has support for your board, sorry
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	progek		answer^
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Core	mwe	I'm sad coz I want to use ubuntu but he don't recognize my machine
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	it is either that or installing ubuntu from a USB CDROM or ethernet
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	psynaps3	ah	got it working :) not to find out which option got it right...
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	pengulord		yea core 2 duo mobos dont mix with linux
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i am running Edgy on a core 2 duo but i had to go through lots of trouble
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	if that's the case it's a rare exception to the rule for none source .debs
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	i think the included xorg drivers for intel can enable DRI (acceleration) for the i915
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	jasin		why do you people have problems with usb? Usb has been suported by the kernel for quit some time now.
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	psynaps3	xtknight	why is that? i din't have any problems with my core2
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	apt-get this and that is not supposed to get the source
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	jasin	it's a chipset/core 2 duo problem
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	and how can i do it. the last drivers from repository are already installed
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	psynaps3	only boards with jmicron controllers and BIOSes with screwed irq routings have issues
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	apt-get what?
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	anything
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	psynaps3	xtknight	ah fine
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	jasin	xtknight	i see
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	only apt-get source foo should get the source
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	lol
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	fedora core 6 and Suse 10.2 are paid?
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	auTONYmous	core	no.
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	no they are free, sues is called opensuse 10.2 (the free one is)
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	a guy on my work loves Suse
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	no luck with the justineclarke site
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	jasin		fedora core 6 is free, you can freely download the iso's all over
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	it's true though. unless you specify apt-get source you don't get the source
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Rio		i want to set up my vsftpd server as described by K.Mandla at http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-91887.html, where i would disallow anonymous logins and allow certain users.  so, my question is, where can i find the two files vsftpd.user_list and vsftpd.ftpusers?  are these files supposed to be created, and if yes, where should i put it?
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	IcedEarth	dont	use SuSE yast is horrible
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	mnoir	mwe	- do you know where they hid the source parm in synaptic - i cannot find it :)
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	the next version of Ubuntu should support core 2 duo without issues

2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	when it will be released?
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	progek		anyone here use gvim as their text editor?
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	yeah, thats true
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	mwe	mnoir	I don't use synaptic, sorry. I'm the command line kind
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	I'm at a loss. It appears your touchpad IS synaptics, but the xorg drivers don't support that particular model

2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	you could also download Debian with a modified kernel, these worked awesome for me.  debian is much like ubuntu: http://kmuto.jp/debian/d-i/
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	jasin	mew	have to download the src's
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	my Kurumim works, but is old!
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	you might be stuck with a USB mouse
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	HardDisk_WP		does anyone here know a teletext viewer for debian othert than alevt?
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and runs only by CD
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	jasin		I dont download source code with apt-get I get it with wget
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	try the debian images i linked above

2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	sorry for bugging you, I can see you are pretty requisited here, but are you look over my issue?
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	its ok i need to keep myself busy ;)   sorry i am really not sure how to intel i915 dri off the top of my head

2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I see. apt-get source will get you any patches that are installed in ubuntu as well though
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	jasin		if i'm going to install a new kernel I wont even attempt doing it with apt-get i'll download the src from kernel.org with wget directly and compile it myself.
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	but I'd say it's sane in some cases. in other cases not ;)
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	Yeah that's what I do as well
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	that sthe bets way to do it

2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	thanks. but what distro should i download? there's no debian, nor ubuntu...
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I believe the ubuntu kernel contains quite a few patches to the vanilla sources though
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	120 MB!
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and i have no CD to burn!

2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	uhhhh gee i have no idea.  type lspci and get the exact model..is it i915GM or something?  it seems like theres some suffix to i915
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	well, I think i will not be able to use my power machine today
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	mnoir	mwe	- good point - you should go outside the ubuntu cocoon only if necessary
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i guess not, you will need a cd for that debian

2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	if would exist a way to "run" the iso as it was a cd...
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I know
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	chable	xtknight	i didnt checked , i got mad
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	do you need anything in 2.6.19 ?
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	xtknight	chable	old logs are saved and they end with .0 i think
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	xtknight	chable	in /var/log/
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	its several versions behind the latest stable release on kernel.org
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	you can mount an iso if that's what you mean but i'm not sure how that would help
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	chable	xtknight	im not on ubuntu anymore

2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	humm...
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I see. then compiling your own kernel is a good idea. I don't see the point if it's only to make sure you are using the latest, though
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i mount it
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	chable		but i want to install the drivers from nvidia official website
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	then run the installer
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	asteroid		what about linphone on 6.10 ? why video are not enable ?
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	yeah I agree
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	without needing a CD
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i'm not familiar with that method but it may be possible
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	thank you very much for the help!
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	jasin		.20 is supposedly going to fix some data corruption problem
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	no problem, i hope it works out
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I compile my own kernels because I don't want a generic kernel with virtually all options enabled resulting in a huge image
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	smart
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	just one thing? the new release will be when?
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	my xorg is 7.0, so i can ignore that page you sent me and go straight to the http://dri.freedesktop.org/snapshots/?
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i am not sure, i think ubuntu releases every 6 months, so maybe in 4 months from now?
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		baaack
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I must admit I don't see much difference but I don't like the feeling of using a bloated kernel ;)

2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	that's odd... i dont have the issue but i also use nvidia
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Core	the latest one was release in October, the next one will be April
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	UpMarc		Can someone help me with sound problems?
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		so the latest is 6.10
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	mwe	Core	there is 6.10
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	uhh i think so
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	mwe	Core	6.06 was delayed
2007-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	mwe	Core	it was supposed to be 6.04
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	xtknight	i had to re-compile the kernel with your config only to compile my own modules
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	n2diy		! release
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	ubotu	Ubuntu	releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Core		i don't undestand: 6.06 and 6.10
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Core		6.10 should never exists
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	mwe	Core	why not
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Core		7.04
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	why?
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	mwe	Core	2006 month 10
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	n2diy	Core	6.10 isn't considered to be stable.
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	mwe	Core	but as ubotu said there are two reales each year
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		6.06 is long-term, so support stands for 5 years... 6.10 is short-term, the support will run out faster
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Core		nwe: coz the next release is in 6 months, so the next is 6.12
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	HymnToLife	n2diy	yes it is
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	mnoir	n2diy	of course it is
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	auTONYmous	core	nope...7.04
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Core	n2diy	really?
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	smurf		what is the default content of /etc/issue and issue.net on edgy?
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	I'm having sound problems with it (6.10)... need help
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Core	no, the next is 7.04
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	mwe	Core	6.10 means 2006 releasy in month 10
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	drivera90		My connection doesn't work right :/
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	i'm downloading http://dri.freedesktop.org/snapshots/i915-20060403-linux.i386.tar.bz2
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	smurf		i've installed a package that changed it
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	sorry, but if a sensory overload here.....i forgot which problem u were having that required a kernel compile?
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Core	n2diy	a thing i know is tha it "is not LTS"
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	smurf		i want to recover the default message
2007-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	n2diy	HymnToLife	Not the impression I got from the website?
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	mwe		not every release is LTS, no
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	i only see xorg 6.9 support, i dont know about xorg 7.0 for intel i'm no familiar with intel cihps
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	flodinee		anyone running e17 that can give me a how to link for ubuntu edgy?
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	chable		it is possible to install ubuntu-desktop on debian ?
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	xtknight	i needed to recompile to make my own modules (ralink-wlan / nvidia)
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	drivera90		I'm online, some websites work, some don't. MLDonkey refuses to connect whatsoever, I can't access one of my IRC servers, and an install through terminal failed halfway through or so.
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	mnoir	n2diy	'stable' is like the legal definition of insanity - according to some, no os is ever 'stable'
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	wait a moment
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	drivera90		Thoughts?
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	i'll try
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	HymnToLife	chable	certainly, just don't expect it to be working :)
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	jasin		2.6.19.1 gives ya 1. fixes to gcc4 mis-compiling certain things 2.     [ALSA]  Fix hang-up at disconnection of usb-audio 3.  fixes to a bunch if dell computer specific stuff, one of which is hda not mounting/unmounting properly 4.    Enables stereo line input for TAS codec 5. AHCI mode SATA patch for Intel ICH9 and so on and so on
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Marelo	xtknight	well, it's expected to have retro-compatibility, no?
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	chable	heh	)
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	n2diy	mnoir	:)
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	chable		then i wont
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	mwe	chable	don't you think dapper .debs will work for that?
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	chable	mwe	i dont know what to say
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	u mean an xorg 6.9 driver will work on 7.0?  sorry, not sure about that
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	core	LTS stands for Long Term Support
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	My sounf stopped working :-(
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	chable	im	kinda new in linux
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	UpMarc		sound
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	chable	im	on experimental stage yet
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Core		so 6.10 is a kind of unstable, "not LTS", release?
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	dev	hi	im having problems burning software.  it keeps making coasters from a dvdrw that i know is good, because i tri-boot the machine.  in dmesg it looks like at boot its detecting my dvdrw twice, and a message about "drive appears confused"
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	smurf		can anyone please run cat /etc/issue and paste it here?
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	I'd like to know if I can reinstall only the sound part...
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	dev		any clue why ubuntu would do this but not gentoo?
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	you had to recompile a kernel in order to compile modules?
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	jasin		that gcc4 fix is a good fix for devs.
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	smurf		just for me to see the default edgy message
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	n2diy	Core	That is my impression.
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	mwe	chable	well I had it intalled in dapper. I think the same procedure would work for edgy even if the debs were meant for dapper
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	mnoir		core - no it is kind of 'stable' release but not LTS
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	jmicron controller by any chance?
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	i had trouble with this
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	domanna	hi	. i`m looking for music in style like in the cartoons, when the happy worker is going smily to the work (you know what i mean)
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	there's a icon on the desktop
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	chable	mwe	i can install ubuntu-desktop on unbuntu
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	chable		but i was wondering if it works on a debian
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	chable		3,.1 sarge
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Core	mnoir	hummm....
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	mwe	chable	huh. please elaborate
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	xtknight	yes, very odd, but without it, it would not work, and even with that i have to manually set the sources-directory
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	no i dont think so, ich8 chipset, gigabyte 965p
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Core		It's so difficult to talk with everybody!!!!!!!!!!
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	chable	mwe	i want to install debian 3,.1 and use gnome 2
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	yes (at this moment I'm with windows, but would like to go back to my Ubuntu)
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	chable		as desktop environment
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	mwe	chable	debian?

2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	chable	dont	u know what debian is ?
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Nookie		is there a chance to set in gnome what fonts kde apps will use?
2007-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	mwe	chable	don't install ubuntu then
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	quasar8888		How can I find a driver for my printer ?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	alecjw	chable	it might, but ubuntu is built on debain sid (or is it etch?) so it might not work
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	there's a combination of the wich works
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	hah nice.. well, it works fine in gentoo.. im not sure why
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	yes... which should I choose?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	newer kernel probably
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	dan2		How do you interrupt a thread?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	there's a combination of them which works
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	well i still get 'drive is confused'
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	smurf		just for me to see the default edgy message
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	smurf		just for me to see the default edgy message
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	2.6.18 vs 2.6.17 in ubuntu..
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	chable	debian	doesnt have gnome 2 still ?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	smurf		can anyone please run cat /etc/issue and paste it here?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	what is the combination?
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	2.6.18 fixes jmicron issues
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	UpMarc		that works
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	that's the point: I don't remember!
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	dev		ahhh
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	jasin		quasar, check out www.linuxprinting.org

2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	siv0x		Can anyone tell me what i did wrong by adding wine repositories in synaptic with:  deb http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb main

2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	Shaked? lol
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	jasin		quasar, you can look under the printer list
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	mwe	chable	you could try installing ubunt-desktop on debian. the worst thing that could happen is it wouldn't work
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	chable	lol	i think it works
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	i'll see whats up, i know this dvdrw is good in windows and gentoo.  so you're right its probably the kernel.
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	jasin		quasar, go there and do that
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	chable	mwe	i know :)
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	k

2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	chable		:)
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	i think the options as they are by the way you have installed is the best
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	mwe	chable	why don't you go ahead and try then ;)
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	Nookie		does anyone knows if there is a chance to set in gnome what fonts kde apps will use?????
2007-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	UpMarc	nolimitsoya	what do you mean?
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		i dont know how that works
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	xtknight	lord_ceiphas	i tried doing that, but i didnt have much success....very difficult... i dont know how Muto managed to repackage sarge with newer kernels
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	from this point you just have to enter in a windows with various
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	this board given me alot of problem.  the 965p.  i feel like gigabyte released a beta product and is testing it on us :P

2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	mwe	Nookie	you'd set that in kcontrol even if you run the program in gnome
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	yup@! :)
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	do you have rev2.0 of DS3?

2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	Jaggz-		does aptitude automatically update its list?
2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	UpMarc	Core	I1ll go back to Ubuntu, then come back here
2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	Core	UpMarc	bellow the controls there's a checkbox

2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	jasin		why would you need a core 2 duo on linux? Linux is fats on just about anything.
2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	wielkidzi		hey
2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	jasin		seems like a waste of $$

2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	xtknight	dev	yeah, same, but edgy wouldnt even use my ich8.  i had to use dapper.  but i had to use a usb-cdrom drive.  then usb is suppoesd to be problematic so oh wow...fortunately usb was not a problem for my config so i was able to get dapper installed then i distupgaded to edgy
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	well I guess if you run a loaded server or something it would make sense
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	Jaggz-	n2diy	thanks...  : ) :)
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	xtknight	jasin	uhhh i need it for vmware

2007-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	Jaggz-	Jose	my idea is that I'd like to be able to, while editing some source code, and realizing that I deleted a variable from a struct.. go look back at a previous version without much difficulty -- from what I read the vim-svn plugin allows the usage of vimdiff.. and if it's done well this might be just what I need
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	CheshireViking	funkja	I'm not sure, i don't think so, how can i check?
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	Core		nwe: then whats the correct date?
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	mwe	Core	there were some bugs and it was not ready for release in april so it was deleayed
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	xtknight	Marelo	sudo apt-get install build-essential kernel-headers-`uname -r`....the rest should be listed in the intel docs somewhere
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	n2diy	HymnToLife	I was guessing at the name for the next LTS?
2007-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	HymnToLife	n2diy	it is unknown yet

2007-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	JosefK	Jaggz-	similar kind of thing in Emacs, and it's trivial to setup a defun/bind for an interactive function that would diff the current file against version-n, and output it to another buffer
2007-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	mwe	n2diy	really. did you come up with a good name?

2007-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	Jaggz-		Perhaps even a GUI -- I spend all my time in X or on a windows system anyway.

2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	UpMarc	mwe	ok,,, then...
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	Seveas	jasin	it does not
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	Seveas		/dev/cdrom links to /dev/hdc
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	jasin		it does on my system
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Seveas		/media/cdrom is only the mountpoint
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Moosebuntu		Does anyone else have this warm fuzzy feeling when they install Ubuntu, instead of upgrading to the draconian WIndows Vista, and shafting Microsoft out of any more control over thyself?
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	jasin		I got a /media/cdrom0
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	hassan2a		can you help me ?
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Moosebuntu	I don't. I haven't touched vista yet :)
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Dunca1		Has anyone had any luck installing Oebe Sync (from www.mp3tunes.com) on Ubuntu Edgy?
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	n2diy	Moosebuntu	yep
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	jasin		and a /media/cdrom
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Seveas	jasin	which is the mountpoint of /dev/cdrom
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	timo901		Moosebuntu:you are now in control ;)
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Seveas		etc..
2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	seamus_ie		hey all, I have a new laptop with a amd turion64 uP, I also have a very slow internet connection so what i'm wondering is if there is much difference between the standard ubuntu cd and the amd 64bit cd apart from the kernel, which I can download a lot easier than the whole cd
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	jasin		seveas, not on my system its not. /dev/hdc is the mount point on my system.
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	Jaggz-		yay.. emacs is installed
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	mwe		I'd rather buy a new laptop than vista. they cost about the same if you want the full featured vista version
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	m12		how do you change window managers?  I just downloaded one, and then restarted X.org, but i'm still in gnome now.
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	i think u should choose the amd64 cd
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	Seveas	jasin	ls -lad /dev/hdc and paste the output
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak		that doesnt sound right :(
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	seamus_ie	chable	Why?
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	HymnToLife	m12	you choose which DE you want to start at the login screen
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	select options at the login screen?
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	Moosebuntu	heh	
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	m12		ohh ok, i thought that was a gnome login screen.
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	Dunca1		chatus: eer installed a 64bit edition? half the hardware drivers aren't available, and 32bit programs have to run in a 32bit emulator, so they run slower
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	it is, but you have options. :)
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	Moosebuntu		Seveas> Neither have I.  Nor do I intend to touch it.  I just wish it had better support for gaming.
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	because its suites your cpu
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	m12	n2diy	then how do i change back if i don't like the new one?  will it have a login screen that is similar?
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	Dunca1	seamus	there's not enough 64bit optimized software for linux (or windows) to justify it - I've got a Athlon 64
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	I don't know, but I would think so?
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	seamus_ie	chable	yes I know but I don't want to spend 24 hours downloading the cd when I have the 32 bit version if the only big difference is the kernel
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	m12	ok	thanks
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	HymnToLife	m12	the login screen won't change unless you tel it to
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	It is probably defaulting to gnome?
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	timo901		Moosebuntu:i know , i will have to have a install of vutsa for games :(
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	seamus_ie	Dunca1	you mean that its not worth my while getting the 64bit cd
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	Jaggz-		any users of xpdf just go running to try kpdf?
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	sorry then
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	jasin		The mount point varies from system to system.
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	chable		:(
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	Jaggz-		what a pretty sparrow-like bird outside.. mustard colored feathers.
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	eniac	ok	I was trying to install  ubuntu version 4
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	timo901		i feel a pirated os comming on
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	chable		i think 64 bit runs faster
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	eniac		found a version 5 disk would that be any better
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	eniac		think version 4 was still using XFree86
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	acm		how do i use an older kernel w/edgy?
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	Dunca1	seamus	yes, your 32bit emulated programs will run slower (except video encoder/decoders and database engines) and your hardware will be much harder to configure
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	timo901		chable:i hate to disgree with you man
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	HymnToLife	acm	just apt-get it from an older repo
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	PriceChild	acm	build it yourself?
2007-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	PriceChild		or that
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	chable	timo901	do u think 64 bit cpus dont run faster then normal cpus
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	acm		there is no easy aptitude cmd to d/l and install..
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	jasin	chable	in linux it does
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	Dunca1	chable	I presumed the 64bit version would be better for me when I first got my athlon 64 too, they explain it better in the ubuntu forums tho (http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185303)
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	chable		in windows too
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	boblics	hello	i have a mounted ntfs partition
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	HymnToLife		ctually, I'd rather download the DEBs from packages.ubuntu.com and install it manually
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	boblics		but i only have read access to it
2007-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	boblics		how do i change that?
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	HymnToLife		!ntfs | boblics
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	ubotu	boblics	To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions - See also !fuse

2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	you need 64bit applications to benefit
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	chable		i just thought logical
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	dev	xtknight	that kernel makes my pata drives go away
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	Marelo		damn!! how difficult could be to run unreal tournament in linux!
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	fab5freddy		i am on an amd 64 x2
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	not very :)
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	Marelo		sometimes i think just to give up and go back do windows
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	chable		i run 3.4 dual core Intel pentium

2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	jasin	yes, that to :)
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	Moosebuntu		Marelo> blasphemy!
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	fab5freddy		is ubuntu the best linux distro for 64 bit?
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	Marelo		hehehehehe
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	Moosebuntu		:)
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	timo901		nolimitsoya:i know but ubuntu 64 has a browser with 64 bit support and even that is is not impressive
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	just get the shell script, execute it and you are done
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	boblics		!fuse
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	ubotu		Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	jasin	nolimitsoya	a lot of people dont realize that they need hardware and apps that support 64bit cpus and they just go out and buy a 64bit cpu, big mistake too.
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	perhaps youve hit another bottleneck than you rprocessor :)
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	ooooooooooooooo no! i've been trought a lot more than that
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	what have you been doing wrong then? ;)

2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	kingace	hello	i installed kde and xfce over top of regular ubuntu, but how do i switch back to gdm?
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	jasin		I'm happy with my 3ghz celery cpu :p
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	i have a theory that 64 was for security
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	mostly DRM
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	kingace	at the login screen, select 'Session' and change it to whatever.
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	HymnToLife	kingace	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	jasin		no need for 64 bit here.
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	i wish i knew. but there's the thing... i'm supposed to DON'T NEED to do anything besides installing the game. see what i mean?
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		Or that :P
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	kingace		uh.. which one
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	thats not true :)
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	jasin		hymntolife, not really
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Dunca1		:S there's nothing wrong with 64bit CPU's - they run just as quick in 32bit as they should
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	jasin		hymntolife, chekc pricewatch
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	Dunca1		they just have the extra capability to do 64bit
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	we will have to agree to disagree
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	you dont. just copy the shell script from the cd, set the x bit, execute it, follow the install through and launch the game
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	Marelo	linux	is so complicated to certain things that we (novices) end up giving up... things that were supposed to be easy. like installing a game.
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	read up please. drm has nothing to do with it
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	chable	linux	is simple
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	i installed the game alright. but it's freezing! like what, 8 fps!
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Marelo	it's not difficule, you're just not used to it
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	HymnToLife		t*
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	mwe	Marelo	most games dont't work in linux no matter if you're a pro or not
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	then you need graphics drivers
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	Marelo	mwe	this one works. it's unreal tournament
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	mwe	but thats not the case here, so...
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	chable		happy new year anyway
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	mwe	Marelo	yeah
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	seamus_ie		so Dunca1 are you now running the 32 bit kernel?
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	i tried
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	jasin		64bit is supposedly more effecient but like nolimitsoya said, all your apps must be 64bit for you to benefit.
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	but...?
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Marelo	Installing a linux game on windows is much harder than installing a windows game on linux, remember that that game was NOT meant to be installed on linux thus it may not be so easy
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	guess? but no changes!
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	just install the normal ubuntu
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	then you probably didnt do it right
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	Dunca1	Marelo	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=82987 hopefully that'll help :)
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	nvidia or ati?
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	chable	im	burning the iso now
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	intel
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	chable		i like 10 mb/sec connection
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	chable		:)
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	jasin	On a normal desktop system, you will not even notice a difference. 64-bit only matters if you have unusual demands, like 4GB RAM, or if you're running a sever.
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle		So...neither.
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	rio		who do you install rpm files that you have already downloaded?
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	mwe	Marelo	I get accelerated 3d on intel. poor performance though
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	chable	rio	rpm -Uvh
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	I mean surely you cant say there is a vast improvement over 32 bit
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	then i wouldnt expect any more than you are getting...

2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	ubotu	rio	RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu does not use RPM, but !APT, and RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous)
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	jasin	hell	64 bit is really nothing, 64 bit microprocessor have been around for over 8 years now.
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	mwe	Marelo	no chance I'd be able to play UT
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	yes i can. as i said, read up
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	why?
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	what's the output of "glxinfo | grep ender"?
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	Marelo	mwe	why?
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	the cards are slow to begin with :)
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	jasin	hell	there's already 256bit microprocessors on the market, granted their not x86 tho.
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	well considering x86_64 is not 64bit really there isnt much of a difference
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	just a minute
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	rio	Jordan_U	quiet dangerous... in what way?
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	mwe	Marelo	because the linux driver gives me poor performance
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	jasin	kitche	true

2007-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rio	Dangerous in that it could ruin your entire install, probably won't but could, If it is a source RPM you should be fine but don't quote me on that :)

2007-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	jasin	I wouldn't know. Regardless, 64-bit does not pose significant benefits for desktop users. It just makes the executables bigger.
2007-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	Marelo	Dunca1	but thanks still

2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	its not that simple...
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	jasin	arrenlex	the bit width  the cpu can chunk is larger, I know how it works.
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	timo901	Only if you are doing certain kinds of encryption
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	acm	erf	i can only find kernel-image-2.4.27-2 when i switch to dapper...
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	does it let you access your mp3 collection remotely?
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	arrenlex	mwe	Yes. However, the current programs are only COMPILED for the 64-bit set, and pose no benefits.

2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	hendrickvp		tnx
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	"direct rendering: no" indicates to me you don't have 3D acceleration.
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	That's not exactly what it says, but you can't have 3D accel without direct rendering.
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	that's what mp3tunes.com does i think; you upload your music collection and then it lets you play/download it from any PC
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	but my card have it, doesn't it? its a Intel i915
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Core		Hey how you passed the year???
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Dunca1		(without software on the other PCs, you just goto the website)
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	timo901		nolimitsoya:if we want improvement we going o have to get new better motherboards and software to make the best out of these 256 bit CPU
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Marelo		i915GM/GMS
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	but its not configured to use it
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arrenlex	Or possibly that you are using XGL ( which you shouldn't need to be with an intel card )
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Core		Here in Rio de Janeiro we had Black Eyed Peas!!!!!!!!
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	yea, i'm still not convinced its a good idea to upload all my music to a remote server
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	no, its not that simple either. please read up and understand what the bit width is a ll about. wikipedia is a good start
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	Jordan_U	Unless I miss my guess, if you are running XGL your applications don't get accel anyway. Yes?
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	and you have xserver-xorg-video-i810 installed?
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	i was looking for a more local solution
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	timo901		nolimitsoya:i bet there will be 512 bit CPU too
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	arrenlex	Yes, that was my point :)
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	then how can i configure to use it?
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	yes
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	k0		anyone know of any good organizers too keep all my tasks and things

2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	And you're not running XGL or something like that? Just plain old X?
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg <- select the right driver to begin with
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	well, i think so. just kde
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	timo901		i know what the bit mean , the bus has been expanded
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	And what's the output of: cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep i810 | wc -l
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	dont know of anything then (i'm here 'cos I can't get mp3tunes to work with ubuntu properly, despite having linux support...)
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	Should be a number.
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	timo901		Be right back
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	do you have your entire collection up there?

2007-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	ubotu	Dunca1	l33t: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

2007-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	marelo	I don't know; everything checks out. I think you should sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg as someone has previously suggested and recreate your conf. Dunno if that will help, though. Sorry... good luck.

Install xserver-xorg-video-ati if you don't already have it, and change your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to use the "radeon" driver. If you haven't modified it, you can use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and select radeon instead.
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	magic_ninja		its supposed to be an OS that is completely compatible with windows

2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	Cyclonus	Jordan_U	- if developers are too lazy to read and understand the license they use, they shouldn't publish their stuff. as far as i can see wine does not complain. only GPL fanatics complain but it's not a GPL issue, it's not illegal and not immoral either. blame the wine developers, if you want to blame anyone

2007-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	ubotu	Ubuntu	like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

2007-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	Dunca1		(no-one gets help with particularly detailed problems here - the forums too busy)
2007-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	ChesMan		Can someone help me get Kiba-Dock setup properly? i kep getting it as a black dock, and all the icons have black over it
2007-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	Jowi	meleeglow	put xp on first master hdd, ubuntu on the second. use a bootmanager such as grub to chose which one to boot
2007-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	jasin	linux_user	wirelessly? you will need to run the second nic to a switch and then connect an access point to that switch.
2007-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	Jowi	ChesMan	if you install it from a .deb try a different one. not all of them work for me either.
2007-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	I know, i know, i kinda solved the problem. hehehe let me explain: i think the problem was in the MESA package installed in my kubuntu, it was the swraster (software rendering) that's why the game was too slow
2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	Yes, I told you, you didn't have 3D acceleration. I was confused as to why.
2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	so i uninstalled it and installed the mesa direct rendering, or something like that
2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	Jowi	ChesMan	kiba-dock_0.1cvs20061018-1_i386.deb is the only one that I have been able to get working in Dapper (never tried edgy)

2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	ChesMan	Jowi	i tried Pricechilds that he has listed on the forums, everyon in the thread seems to be getting it to work, even after a reinstall it doesnt work .. :( lol

2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	That has to be the vaguest description ever, but I'm glad you fixed it. xD
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	but now the game is ULTRA FAST, "unplayable", even the game clock is fast
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	LOL XD
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	Is this a game you're running with wine?
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	it's really really fast, like fast fowarding a tape hehehe
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	no! the game is native
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	jasin	linux_user	it would be cheaper just to scrap the second nic and use a router with wifi built in.
2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	emun	.tar.gz is an archive. Like .zip. You extract it.
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	Jowi	ChesMan	you need composite turned on. check if /etc/X11/xorg.conf contain a "Section "Extensions"" with Composite Enabled in it.
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	Marelo	What game is this?
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	Marelo	arrenlex	unreal tournament
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	jasin	linux_user	if you insit on ussing two nics you can do it the way I originally suggested, get a switch and an access point.
2007-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	thugren	Hello	So how do I enable the root user in ubuntu?

2007-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	jasin	linux_user	if you look around you might be able to find an ethernet 10/100 wired switch with wifi built in, I dont know of any that exists though.
2007-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	LoneVVolf		I have an old PC with Intel 815, and the default installation doesn't really seem to be speedy on updating.  Is there any way to get accelerated drivers?
2007-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	jasin	linux_user	get an active powered switch if you do get one.
2007-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	LoneVVolf	The xserver-xorg-video-i810 package should give you drivers.

2007-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	jasin		tab,am, on that system i'd use xubuntu

2007-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	LoneVVolf	yeah	I have that installed...doesn't seem to be very fast, though
2007-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	emun		when you extract the printer driver tar.gz onto the desktop is that all , can you use the drivers , you have to do something else
2007-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	jasin		tabm, on that system i'd use xubuntu
2007-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	LoneVVolf		but I guess if that's the best there is...
2007-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	LoneVVolf		In fact, it's really slow

2007-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	floppyears	tyme-	yeah, at the end is the kernel
2007-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	jasin		Verd, clam TK is a good virus scanner
2007-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	jasin		Verd, http://clamtk.sourceforge.net/
2007-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		so with the firewall, just pick one out of synaptics that looks good (I have heard of people making their own with configurations but that is way beyond me)
2007-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	jasin		Verd, firestarter is a good firewall, http://www.fs-security.com/download.php

2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	niko_m		will 10 gigs do?
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	Login7	arrenlex	so xubuntu can install all programs that ubuntu can install too?
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	Login7	Of course.
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	niko_m		i have a 320 external hard drive also that is fat 32
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	DarthLappy	Login7	Think of Xubuntu *as* Ubuntu.
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	Login7	If you start with ubuntu, then remove ubuntu-desktop, then install xubuntu-desktop, you get exactly the same result as if you'd installed xubuntu.
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	mhiku	umm	out of topic but which is the best cms to choose from?
2007-01-01T09:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	personally i would use 10gigs at the least
2007-01-01T09:27:00.000Z	Login7	arrenlex	Thanks.

2007-01-01T09:27:00.000Z	MooUK		Right... I was following the desktop guide to get my nvidia graphics card working properly. (https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/graphics-cards.html). I was having problems, so I searched the wiki. A page there (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia) gave more detailed instructions, including one that for Edgy gave a different instruction to get the driver working than the desktop guide does. In other
2007-01-01T09:27:00.000Z	MooUK		words, the desktop guide has a mistake in...
2007-01-01T09:27:00.000Z	x-ip		i dont have splashy in the repositorys

2007-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	jasin	xubuntu	dsl, slax, puppy linux, and Feather Linux  are all for older systems
2007-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	niko_m		so is 10 gigs enough for a basic install of xubutnu edgy?
2007-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	yes xubuntu is about 2-3gig
2007-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	niko_m	ok	cool
2007-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	DarthLappy	jasin	I find Xubuntu very nice on my newer system :D
2007-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	jeff__		I'm trying to determin which kernel image to use for my AMD Dual core cpu, would it be an SMP type?
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	that leaves around 7ish gigs for other apps music whatever you want
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	jeff__		its a laptop, Acer 5101
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	hepme		if i have a computer that has no harddrives installed, and just run ubuntu off  liveCD, is that considered a 'diskless workstation'?
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	niko_m		so i just have to use partition commander to resize my windows partition to make space for xubuntu and then when i install linux it will make set xubuntu in the unused space right?
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	jasin		darthlappy lol
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	arrenlex	jeff__	Edgy or dapper?
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	jeff__		edgy
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	arrenlex	jeff__	-generic.
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	arrenlex		!generic | jeff__
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	ubotu	jeff__	Background to the decision to replace -686, k7 and -smp kernels with -generic can be found here https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-August/019983.html (the -386 kernel is still available if needed)
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	lufis		How do I mount a drive in the ubuntu livecd?
2007-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	you can use the xubuntu installer to do that
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	arrenlex	jeff__	apt-get install linux-kernel-generic
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	leexgx	jeff__	start system monitor and see if the kernel has seen the 2 cpus
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	niko_m		as long as i don't tell it to use the whole hard drive
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	Login7	ubuntu	is updated automatically?
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	J-_		Is there a way to get 2 DE's running at the same time on the same computer so I can switch over to one whilst learning how to use the other?
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	niko_m		i rather not use linux to mess with ntfs paritions
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		with the firestarter firewall will that slow up my comp
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	niko_m		i prefer to use partition commander
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	jasin		I dont like that little box, I need toolbars, menubars, a desktop,etc.. :p
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	right there is a part wher eyou can choose how much space to use
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	lufis	VerdRousseau	It shouldn't
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	x-r00t-x		hello can anyone tell me where do i get alarm clock for ubuntu
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	niko_m		then just run the xubuntu install and tell it to used the unused space and make whaterver paritions it wants for linux
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	jasin	verd	no
2007-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	fit4lfe_		how do I set up my screen for hdtv
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	thats fine
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	lufis	VerdRousseau	The Linux firewall runs without firestarter -- firestarter AFAIK is just a front-end for editing it
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	niko_m		will xubuntu install grub?
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		and also when for the roots sign in how do I get it so they cant sign in
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	niko_m	yes
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	niko_m	ok	
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	jeff__	leexgx	I guess the default AMD 64 bit has both CPu running
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	niko_m		has anyone ever use system commander before?
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		lufis- so ubuntu comes with a firewall preinstalled?
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	jasin		!xubuntu
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	ubotu	Xubuntu	is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop"
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	lufis	VerdRousseau	Yep
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	niko_m		i'm wondering if its any good
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	umgan		I am recieving this error from wine. "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"  Could someone show me how to completely remove and reinstall it?
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		back to about the rootsw
2007-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		how do I set it so they cant sign in
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	lufis	VerdRousseau	It's in the kernel, if you want to get technical, so all recent distros have one running
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	jasin		iptables is not a firewall
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	J-_		Is there a way to get 2 DE's running at the same time on the same computer so I can switch over to one whilst learning how to use the other?
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	MooUK	niko_m	if you're using an older machine, it's great. It is slightly harder in some cases to find appropriate software, however.
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	jasin		saying linux comes with a firewall preinstalled is subjective
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	lufis	jasin	Oh. I guess not then
2007-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		so firestarter is my best bet
2007-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	lufis		I'm running the Dapper livecd right now and I want to access some files on a local HD. The partitions on the hd show up in Nautilus but trying to open them doesn't work. I tried umount'ing them and that doesn't work either. Any ideas?
2007-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	sladen	lufis	what does 'mount' show
2007-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	jeff__		next question, wireless with  WPA-Pre Shared Key, TPIK wireless dont seem to be able to connect? any tips?
2007-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	lufis	sladen	Mount doesn't show that they're mounted at all, which is strange
2007-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	sladen	lufis	if you unmonunted them, did you re-mount them
2007-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	lufis	sladen	Umount won't work
2007-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	sladen	lufis	what message does it give, what command did you type
2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	sladen	lufis	umount means 'unmount' which means they are no longer accessible
2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	lufis	sladen	Trying to open them in nautilus gives "error: device /dev/hda1 is not removable, error: could not execute pmount"
2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	lufis	sladen	Right. I was going to unmount them and mount them manually to see if that would work
2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	tyme-	jeff__	get a better network manager app
2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	leexgx	jeff__	if you installed from an 6.06 or 6.10 disk the generic kernel will of been used that is SMP enabled (if you Upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 you need to get the new one as it seems to install i386 not generic one)
2007-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	sladen	lufis	sudo mount ... then
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	lufis	sladen	Running mount gives: mount: /dev/hda already mounted or /home/ubuntu/Desktop/HD busy
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	Twinxor		any recommendation for a program to burn a .BIN and .CUE to CD?
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	sladen	lufis	mount | grep hda ?
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	VerdRousseau	im	lookin at synaptic and they offer all this firewall stuff like fwbuilder are these not necessary for the basic user like me?
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	leexgx	6.06 still uses the 686 kernel
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	lufis	sladen	Comes back with no text
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	sladen	Twinxor	right-click the .bin and click 'burn'.
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	timo901	sudo	nautilus  /home/ubuntu/Desktop/HD busy
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	lufis	VerdRousseau	Firestarter is good, i've had no problems with it
2007-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	sladen	timo901	nooooooooo.

2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	fredl		it's not the fastest site on the planet since it's at my DSL connection :-)
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	fr500__		Aidan weird
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	whats the purpouse of this project?
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	AidanL		Yeah I know...
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	pegger_		what is the different if i install the xubuntu or install the xfce for the ubuntu?
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		just ran sudo dpkg -i gtkwifi.deb; dont know where to find it on my desktop?
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	the purpose is described on http://wiki.3dn.nl/index.php/GLUE
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	pegger_	the xubuntu package will include loads (diffrent) of defaults and some common apps
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	the description is fairly terse however.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	rogue780		can someone reccomend a text-based gcc IDE similar to RHIDE for djgpp?
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	fredl		Either way, 'GLUE' is supposed to be a layer on top of the so many existing version control / bugtracking / SCM products.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	dhq	name	mine is a intel laptop with bluetooth nuiltin
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	dhq		builtin
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	s34n		what do I have to do to discover and mount existing lvm volumes?
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	fredl		does that make enough sense?
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	rogue780		can someone reccomend a text-based gcc IDE?
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	rogue780		besides emacs
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	fredl		IDE?
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	HymnToLife		vim :)
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	rogue780	bash+vi? ;)
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		Anyone know where to find gtkwifi?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	fredl		yeah.. haha, text based IDE = bash
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	ExM3th1x		could anybody tell me how to enable overburn in gnomebaker?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	ExM3th1x	iam	using version 0.6.0
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	ExM3th1x		(edgy)
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	trev__	ok	i am playing tremulous, can anyone tell me what to set the permissions to its config file in my home folder so i can save my options?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	fr500__	VerdRousseau	i guess you gotta add it to the panel, right click the panel and add it, should try networkmanager tho
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	trev__	chown username:group /folder
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya		*-r
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	fredl		anybody have any comment/questions on GLUE ?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	trev__	ok	thx
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		do you have to install network manager or where is it?
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	im not sure... what would be diffrent from, say, launchpad?
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	tritium	VerdRousseau	no, you don't have to, but if you want to, you certainly can
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		I mean is it already installed?
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	well it's not a bugtracking system OR a version control system itself.....
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	mnoir	pegger_	if you install xfce on top of ubuntu you will have all the gnome tools as well.  There is not a very great difference.  maybe #xubuntu would be a good place to discuss
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	dhq		need help setting up bluetooth i cannot discover bluetooth from my cell nothing i am using a intel dell latitude d505 laptop bluetooth builtin
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	right... so its just a web interface?
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	trev__		nolimitsoya:what do you set the group to
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	it's supposed to be an application that keeps track of software modules, in which version control system they're kept, which bugtracking system is used for it etc.
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	superjoe_		anyone willing to help me connect to my wireles network from hp laptop w ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	trev__	whatever group you belong to
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		so you reccomend network manager over gtkwifi?
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	pegger_		thanx mnoir
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	mnoir	np	good luck
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	trev__		nolimitsoya:im a little confused, what group does the default user usually belong to?
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	nope, not quite. When the database is populated, GLUE should be able to use all this information to generate 'releases' coming from different repositories/bugtracking systems.
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	trev__	same as your username
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	trev__	ok	
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	trev__		nolimitsoya:thx
2007-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	mnoir	trev__	by convention, every user belongs to a group of the same name as the user.  the first user you make when installing also belongs to many other groups
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	fiveiron		where are HDDs mounted now?  not in /etc/fstab anymore i see
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	fritsch		hi! is there a way to just build the "generic" kernel from the 2.6.20 feisty kernel
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	fritsch		it lasted over 5 hours to build me the whole stuff from this package
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	mnoir	trev__	to see, in terminal type 'grep username /etc/group'
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	mnoir		or just 'less /etc/group'
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	trev__	thx	
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	don't bother unless you absolutely need to
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	tk_		hey.. how do i reinstall the x server on ubuntu 6.10?
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	additionally, GLUE should be able to generate (automatically) things like RPM's, DEB's etc. depending on the component's settings.
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	there must be an option, an argument i think?
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	stooge4ever	hey	my liveCD won't boot - on 6.06, errors appear having to do with the ide and hdc, and on 6.10, the screen freezes while the OS is booting up; i think they freeze at around the same place
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	nope
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	Why are you building a custom kernel?  Do you really need to?
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	yes i do
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i build kernels now over five years, so this is not the problem, i just wanted to stick to the ubuntu packages
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	what is the need that the stock kernel does not address for you?
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	am I making any sense? :-)
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	some patches, for exampe acpi ones
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	and the ubuntu version is more integrated
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i do not have to google hours to search important patches and apply them myself
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	some. :) a more stringent description on the website, and a link to a faq, would probably be helpfull in generating more intrest :)
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	if you want packages, be sure to install kernel-package and use make-kpkg
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	some even get rejected, i have to fix them to apply mysel
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	okay ;-) sorry, i do not think you can really help me
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	hey I built what I have in 4 days and I'm just cranking away at coding, I have no time to document stuff yet!
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fredl		:)
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	you haven't asked anything
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	as i said above, i build debian kernel images for years now
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i did
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	AidanL		How do I get to root in terminal as I need to get to root in order to "make install" for ndiswrapper.
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i get the linux-image source from the feisty kernel
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	but without it, you wont have much luck recruiting, and thats what you wanted, wasnt it?
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	agfter that i ran a dpkg-buildpackage to compile it on edgy
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	just imagine... 'glue build UBUNTU.ubuntu.org'
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	^^	
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	problem is: bigiron, 386, etc. kernels are build this needs 5 hours
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	doviende	AidanL	"sudo make install"
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i just want to compile the generic version
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	tritium		You can't, as I said, from the linux-source packages
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i think i can, i just look into debian/rules
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	AidanL	ok	thanks.
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	fredl		that should hopefully explain it better :) that command should get a list of all components in UBUNTU.ubuntu.org, for each of the components it should check all packages for open bugs, check out the revisions from the respective version control systems, and build debs!
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	but i thought somebody has it handy for me already
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	AidanL		it tells me no rule to make target 'install'
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		hi! I have Ubuntu Drapper installed and my wireless card shows up in the networking app. Yet I'm not able to connect to the local wireless router
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	zcherus		can someone recommend me good sftp daemon and possibly a guide for setting it up (including fxps)
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	what did you use to attempt to connect?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	but you're right.... I'll document the purpose more clearly and come back and ask more :)
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	stooge4ever		does anybody know whether there are compatibility issues b/t the ubuntu liveCD and an ATI Radeon card?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	just found it
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		the networking app that comes with drapper
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	zcherus		!fxps
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	ubotu	Sorry	I don't know anything about fxps - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	AidanL	stooge4ever	- I don't think it is, I had trouble.
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	fredl		drapper?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	in debian/control i just comment out the packages i do not need
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	and is your wireless router using WEP or WPA or no encryption?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	mnoir	AidanL	then you are not in the right place or not following directions or using a package that is not conventionally made
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	stooge4ever	AidanL	you don't think what is?
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	hjmills		what stuff do i need to install for java in firefox?
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	there is no encryption
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	mnoir		!java
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	ubotu		To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	mwe		!java | hjmills
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	ubotu	hjmills	To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	AidanL		I don't think that ATI radeon cards a compatible
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	braddcadd2000		Anyone willing to help configure my scanner through xsane?
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	mwe	hjmills	it comes with the plugin as well
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	stooge4ever		so what should i do? revert to my orig. card?
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	hjmills	mnoir	and mwe: thanks
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	mnoir	hth	)
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	AidanL		because I had major problems using Live CD. I ended up downloading the ALT download and then recongifuring the x-server and set the driver as Versa (I think) and NOT ATI.
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	ok, open a terminal and type "sudo iwlist scanning" and tell me if it sees your wireless router there
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	hjmills	mwe	that was the important bit - i didnt know if that was the plugin and all
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	AidanL		You could try although im not sure what that would do.
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	mwe	hjmills	come back if you can't get java to work in your browser after you have installed that
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		Now I just downloaded and installed network manager but not sure where It shows up have no idea where it is?
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	mwe	hjmills	you probably need to create a symlink. We'll explain how
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	stooge4ever	well	my original card (still in the comp) is integrated with the oard, and it's worked before with dapper
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	hjmills	VerdRousseau	eurgh - fiddled with that earlier - always seems to break my pc - good luck
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Musashi		what
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	mnoir	verd	- if you know synaptic - use it to locate any file in the package
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	HentaiSushi_		um
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		Ib see 4
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	HentaiSushi_		i tried the live cd and it wouldnt run
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	AidanL	stooge	you could try that then.
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	pista		i've updated to feisty alpha, and now my sata2 drive (asus p5b-e, jmicron ich8) is slow (hdparm -tT /dev/hda shows buffered disk read 3MBps). what can be the problem?
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	adamE		alright
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		all say "Interfernce doesn't support scanning."
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Twinxor		how should I format this USB stick so it's all one partition?
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		so what do I do with synaptic mnoir (kinda confused)
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	pista	#ubuntu+1
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	mwe	pista	the problem could be that fiesty is totally unstable
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	hmm....ok, i guess there's still some problem with drivers or something
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		except eth1 it says "Interfernce doesn't support sscanning. : No Such Device"
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	i will start at beginning - how did you install it?
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	what type of wireless device?
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		eth1 is wireless adapter
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		through synaptic
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	mwe	Commander-Crowe	iwconfig
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	so what? install ndiswrapper?
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	I'm not sure
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	mnoir	ok	- is synaptic still open?
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	AidanL		Could someone assist me with the install of ndiswrapper. I am struggling... again.
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		yes

2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	you got to a little more specific ;)

2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	Tann		where can i download ndiswrapper for Edgy?
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	got to be*
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	AidanL	can you get the computer in question on the internet somehow? (so you can install stuff.)
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	you think as kind of backup?
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	mnoir		good - go to settings - preferences
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	AidanL	No	.
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	yes

2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	i would suggest you to use partimage
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	phr34ck		because I downloaded so many updates, and I don't want to do that each time I install Ubuntu.
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	Tann		where can i download ndiswrapper for Edgy?

2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	i think all we need to know is that it's a broadcom 4306
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	can you extract it and compile?
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	mnoir		make sure is highlit and click installed files tab
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	AidanL		I can extraxt it yes
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	be careful to save the image to another partition
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	AidanL		extract*
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		k
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	but not compile?
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	you cannot backup a partition and write the backup to it
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	sure.
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	Tann		Hello?
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	hello!
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	phr34ck		First I have to search for the software ;p
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	AidanL		I don't think so. But I am not sure. (forgive me, I am new to all this)
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	sudo apt-get install partimage
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	mnoir		prolly many files - look for it in a dir with /bin/ in the string
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	phr34ck	aha	great.
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	where can i download ndiswrapper for Edgy?
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	you need to install linux-headers-$(uname -r) and build-essential or else it wont compile
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	phr34ck		Thanks.
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	hjmills	AidanL	try getting the deb from packages.ubuntu.com and installing that
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	apt-cache search ndiswrapper
2007-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	perhaps it is already installed
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		mnoir-what are we looking for?
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	Tann		i don't have internet
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	you are online now?
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	network manager?
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	Tann		it is not installed
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	ndiswrapper is already patched in the ubuntu kernel
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	you just need the utils
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	on a different
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	Tann		comp
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	AidanL	Ok	mwe and hjmills. I will try that.
2007-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	look for files in /usr/bin
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	just apt-get it on you current and copy the deb file from /var/cache/apt/archives/
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=201902&highlight=broadcom+4306
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	to the other one
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	that seems to be for your wireless adapter
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	building from source and installing a binary .deb are fundamentally different ;)
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	6.06 or 6.10?
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	my current has win
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		k here /usr/bin/nm-appplet?
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	ah perhaps better ;-)
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		6.10
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	AidanL		I see.
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	phr34ck	meh	it's not connecting to archive.ubuntu.com
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	ok	
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	just go to packages.ubuntu.com
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	mnoir		ah - great - i can show you how to make a click for it...
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		For all of you who need to set up ndiswrapper, and don't have an internet connection on that computer, I have collected some useful Wifi packages for edgy, you can find them here: http://bhs2007.googlepages.com/edgy-wifi.zip
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	Tann	ok	
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	wrong proxy?
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	unfortunately this type of wireless adapter seems to take more effort than others
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		alright...
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	remeber to fetch the right version
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		ahhh it's working now
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	mwe		if you use the applet to install the network it will only work if gnome is running wont it?
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		Put those on some kind of disk and install them on the PC... they'll all even fit on a floppy
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	k
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	you are running gnome or kde?
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	I want to ask you. How can I "permentaly" change the mac addres?
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	arn0ld		Hi I'm having a problem with my mouse, the sensitivity is still way too high in games even with the lowest settings on
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	MuffY		what is everyones favourite text editor
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		gnome
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	MuffY		as in code editor (C/C++ code)
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	that's a religous question ;)
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	permanent, also when your computer is poered off
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	phr34ck		each time I boot Ubuntu, I go to change the mac address .. it's a pain in the behind.
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	MuffY		i know :P
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	no go (for easy)
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	mnoir		k - right click your bar at the top
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	hjmills	MuffY	vim
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	MuffY		but i have no idea now
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	mnoir		in a blank area
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	arn0ld		does anyone know of a way I can manually edit the mouse sensitivity?
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	but you could run a random mac change script
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	probably vim or emacs
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	yeah I'm used to ndiswraper...its all I ever used
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	MuffY		so after the rampage i'll have some options to choose from
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		k
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	MuffY		woo

2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	Do you think it will be easy to create a script and run it at boot ?
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	first item should be add to panel - clickit
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	very easy
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	MuffY		will check now, and please don't start a holy war while i'm gone =p
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	sudo apt-get install macchanger
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	if everything's working, you should be able to see the card in iwconfig and you should be able to scan with iwlist
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	phr34ck	Kay	will do.
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		k
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	arn0ld		can anyone help

2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	mwe		!helpme
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	ubotu		Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	mnoir		you get big window of stuff?
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		yes
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	hjmills	arn0ld	its in the gnome mouse setting panel
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	ok...right now I'm using the eth0 connection
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	thanks a lot.
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	arn0ld		its already lowest there
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	mnoir		it should be somewhere there
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Try typing vimtutor
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	no problem
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	to get you started
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	arn0ld		The problem is I need it lower
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	MuffY		?
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		the network manager should be
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	MuffY		here?
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	mnoir		yes
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	MuffY		!vimtutor
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	hjmills	arn0ld	why lower?
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	ubotu	Sorry	I don't know anything about vimtutor - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	yes
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Not here, vimtutuor is a tutorial on how to use vim
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	partimage will save all these packages, yes ?
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	arn0ld		Need it lower to play a game
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		no only thing is network monitor but already have that
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	mwe		figuring out how to quit emacs the first time can be a challenge as well ;)
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	mnoir		hrmmmm
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It has a little bit of a learning curve
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	it will same your partition
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	ah, on the internets?
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	as an image
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		do I haved to do a custom app launch?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	i am lost
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	i don;t mind
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	From the command line
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	i have the time
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	are you running 6.06 or 6.10?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	AidanL	Tann, have you got the ndiswrapper stuff figured out?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	phr34ck		So lets say I have formatted my computer, how can I restore it?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	you just want to save the "downloaded" pacakges?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY		(and hopefully the patience)
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	do i need the common and utils?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY		?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY	nono	
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		6.10
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	you boot with lets say knoppix (or something else)
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	yeah something like that.
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY		i just want something to write code in
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	mnoir		give me 2 min to find on my sys
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		k
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It is very similar to vi, which should be installed on any unix like machine
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	then you run partimage an just play your old image in
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY		with syntax highlighting and such
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	phr34ck		Like yesterday, I updated 82 packages and it took the whole day.
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	pianoboy3333		Anyone here good with ndiswrapper?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	emacs. don't believe people who tell you to use vim ;)
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	phr34ck		I don't want that to happen when I install ubuntu ...
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	some packages are in /var/cache/apt/archives/
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	AidanL		I have installed ndiswrapper from a .dab package. Whereabouts will it be stored so I can access it?
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	but i do not think just saving them ist sufficant
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	pianoboy3333	everybody's going nuts over ndiswrapper right now :S
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	AidanL		I have found it. Forgive me.
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Emacs or Vi/Vim are both good choices for writing code
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	tritium	AidanL	via apt?  /var/cache/apt/archives
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	mwe	AidanL	if it worked, sudo modprobe ndiswrapper should work
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	because having the packages is not a mirror itself (a packages mirror)
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	phr34ck	well	I think will make an imagine and will learn how to make work and everything.
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	MuffY	ok	
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Syntax highlighting, code folding, etc.
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	i am installing - 2 more min :)
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	dev		i just installed ubuntu like a day ago, went to play a clip on cnn in firefox and it says totem is unable to handle mms
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		k no problem

2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	AidanL		I don't know where to find the driver. That is a problem I am having/
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	tritium	AidanL	you installed the ubuntu package, I hope?
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	fritsch	Tann	later they are installed with: sudo dpkg -i "the above named packeges"
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	MuffY		at least his name is dutch
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	you get the driver from the manufacturer's CD or site...
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	vim is supposed to provide vimtutor
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	AidanL		Tritium, I did yes.
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	AidanL		I see.
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	tritium		good
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		you'll find an inf file somewhere
2007-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		when I do install network manager which one do I click on regular network manager or network manager gnome?
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	bds	mwe	I thought it did as well o_0
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	ok

2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	AidanL		I will do that now then. I am very sorry about this. I am new to Ubuntu.
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	AidanL	no need to apologize :)
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	mwe	bds	it does I'm sure ;) odd
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	VerdRousseau	lol	alright soudn good but did you see that question before that

2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		about which one to install
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	MuffY		uhm, bds, vim doesn;t really look splendid

2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	no problem. Ndiswrapper isn't a wireless driver, it's something that lets you use Windows wireless card drivers in linux.
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	now start typing ;)
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	an apt proxy you could also install
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	MuffY		i did
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	where did it show before?
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Everflex		how do i make a Volume behave like the /home directory (so i can write to it without root)
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Argoran	lots of people here use it - just ask your question, you should get help...
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		Never mind it installs both when you click one
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Cypher		how can i daul boot with windows
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	you have to mount it correctly
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	bds		Is vimtutor a seperate package?
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	MuffY		but it doesn;t highlight anything =(
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	did you get that link I sent out earlier? It contains ndisgtk, it makes it a -tad- easier, and it also includes some other useful wifi packages.
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Cypher		menu.lst need to be configured
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	mnoir	VerdRousseau	you all set?
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	:q! to quit or :w to save the file. it will use highlighting by default I think. there is gvim if you want a more windows like thingy
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Argoran	ok	thx Madpilot
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Cypher		how to do that
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	you shouldn't ask me =p
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	I'm looking for something that will do my work at boot time. Like each time I want to change the mac-address "and that happens each time I want to connect to the internet", I do the following:
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It does, you need to se up your .vimrc file
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	phr34ck	sudo	ifconfig eth0 down
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Everflex	fritsch	i'm mounting it with fstab, but i just can't find an option that does what i want.
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	phr34ck	sudo	ifconfig eth0 hw ether MACADDRESS
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	hjmills	MuffY	run "sudo updatedb && locate vimrc" then edit that file and turn syntax highlighting on
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Argoran		my problem with XChat is following: The buddylist should normally be on the right of the windows, but it isn't
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	phr34ck	sudo	ifconfig eth0 up
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	http://bhs2007.googlepages.com/edgy-wifi.zip
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	AidanL		It is telling me that HArdware isn't present. Although it is.
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	phr34ck		I just want these 3 steps to be done at boot time.
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Argoran		can anybody give me a advice how to activate the buddy-list?
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	umask set correctly?
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	it should hightlight depending on the extension by default I think
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Argoran	there's #xchat for xchat support
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Argoran		thank you BHSPitLappy
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	/dev/sda2 /media/sda2     ntfs    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	this is an example
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fr500__	Argoran	see the icon that says 925 users?
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	the device /dev/Sda2 is mounted to /media/sda2 <- this is a local directory, this must exist
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	MuffY	hjmills	it gives a "how to use apt-get" thing
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fr500__		click there
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	MuffY		so i think the syntax isn;t right
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	hmm. and you gave it the proper .inf file?
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	hjmills	MuffY	that update db && ... command?
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Argoran	fr500__	no I can't see it
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	just a script like this
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	MuffY		nm hjmills
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Everflex	fritsch	yeah.. i have the drive mounted and all (it's ext3) but i can only write to it with root.,.
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	hjmills	MuffY	that shouldnt be anything to do with apt
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	#!/bin/sh
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	AidanL	yes	the name: blkwgu.inf
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	hjmills	MuffY	kk
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	MuffY		i saw too many apt-gets today, i lost a bit of your code :P
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	ifconfig eth0 down
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fr500__	Argoran	never mind, i'm with xchat-gnome sorry
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	LinTux		I would like to install Xara Extreme in Kubuntu, what is the command in terminal to use as I cannot find the package?
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	MuffY		my eeeyyeesss
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	AidanL		I dragged it into the blank white area and it was trying to install.
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	ah, it's a belkin...
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Everflex	fritsch	is it possible to use umask with ext3?
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	only files with extension like .c or whatever will be highlighted in vim I think
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	Argoran	are you running the real XChat, or the awful & useless XChat-Gnome?
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	AidanL		Yeah...
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	AidanL		It now says HArdware PResent.
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	This is my .vimrc
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		good
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	macchanger eth0 "YOUR MAC"
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	thats all
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/165/
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	phr34ck	fritsch	interesting.
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Argoran	Madpilot	its the gnome version
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		I should read an articale about how making scripting for boot time.
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	you do not need to, just look, that the directory you mount to has the correct permissions
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	AidanL		Although I don't know what to do next...
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		Do you know how I can configure my boot >?
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	your what?
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	LinTux		can anyone help me to install Xara Extreme in Kubuntu
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	easiest way is:
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	did you get that link I sent you earlier
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		Like Ubuntu does some stuff that I don't need "bluetooth and raid and stuff like that"
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	AidanL		Yeah
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Argoran	ick. Ditch that, use the older, better XChat. Xchat-gnome has some sort of goofy popup user list that can't be configured.
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	AidanL		The Edgy Packages.
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	fritsch	phr34ck	just append these lines to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	Everflex	fritsch	so what should i use to change the permissions to that, chmod?
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	mwe	bds	syntax highlighting is disabled by default? I guess I must have enabled it without giving thought to it
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	AidanL		Do I install all of the packages on there?
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	chown and chmod
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	chown ist enough
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	it contains network-manager-gnome, you'll want that.
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	just for the record, i am a total n00b regarding anything ubuntu does
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	phr34ck		that file is responsible for the boot ?
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	lets say you want to mount /dev/hda3 to /media/lala
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	fritsch	Everflex	an the user "heinz" should be able to write to this directory
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	from a terminal type the following 'vim ~/.vimrc'
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	AidanL		Righty Ill install that and report back:)
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	fritsch		just do chown heinz:users /media/lala
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		aye aye.
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	Argoran	ok	thx Madpilot
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	fritsch		and mount /dev/hda3 per default to this directory
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	When vim loads press 'i' to insert
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	LinTux		does anybody know the name for the package Xara Extreme so that I can install it via terminal
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Type or paste the options you want
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	mwe	fritsch	permissions of mount points have no effect once a file system is mounted ;)
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	Tann	fritsch	thanks
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	mwe	fritsch	only options to mount do
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	MuffY		ok?
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Then hit the escape key and type ':wq!'
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	mwe	fritsch	like umask etc
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	just make sure to say my name in here, so I'll notice.
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Those setting will now be loaded everytime you start vim
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	AidanL	BHSPitLappy	Ah, it tells me the Dependency is not satisfyable: network Manager.
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Everflex	mwe	okay, so is it in the fstab file i cahange wether i can write to the disk or not without root?

2007-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	MuffY		:p

2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	bds	ThugRen	What do you mean you 'did the sudo' I missed the first part of your question
2007-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	mwe	lipe_	you need to know what you're doing or install an ubuntu .deb
2007-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	ThugRen	bds	I was try to enable my root user and I didn't seem to enable it.

2007-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	pike_	poraki_poralli	you might need to edit /etc/fstab if # hard drives is diff i guess but should work ok
2007-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	adam_	mwe	thats what I was hoping... I'll have a look at some links and see what I can do.
2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	mnoir	lipe_	if all you have is a tarfile then install is running tar on it
2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	bds	ThugRen	Ah, sorry I have not enabled the root user as I have been sticking to sudo :(
2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	ThugRen	you don't really need an active root user in Ubuntu... it's set up to run from sudo instead
2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	it -might- help to log off and/or reboot at this point.  Can't promise anything, though
2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	jasin		thats where it is, if its not there on your system I dont know what to tell you but thats the default location in eddgy

2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	AidanL	BHSPitLappy	Would it have made any difference of wpagui wouldn't install?
2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	s34n	tyme-	is it available from a convenient repo?
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	binarydigit	high_rogue_speed	use the livecd and find out
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	lipe_	mnoir	'cause i need to know if i need to put some PATH ...
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	mwe	adam_	people are usually helpful in here. crimsun is _the_ sound guru. I don't think he's around right now though
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	lipe_	mnoir	or something like that ...
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	pike_	high_rogue_speed	xubuntu mightbe a better idea than ubuntu(gnome)
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	tyme-	s34n	i don't know, i just did apt-cache search for you
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	not really
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	mnoir	lipe_	did you use sudo for the make install?
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	AidanL	Ok	.
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	that one wasn't tied in with the others

2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	MuffY		i know, but for some reason most people get the free software
2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	MuffY		i wonder why
2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	binarydigit	arrenlex	has to get in shape for the new year
2007-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	ikonia		I did an update on my laptop from 6.10 to Edgy. After that update my screen savers don't kick in and my "hover" preview of say an audio file doesn't work
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	MuffY		;)
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	ikonia		is this a common thing
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	sharp15	ok	. i'm confused.  i know ubuntu is gnome based, but i installed kde.  is there a reason that would mess with sshd and proftpd?
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	heh
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	oh, sorry to hear that.  I didn't even realize it was USB
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	AidanL		Yeah it is...
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	pipas		high rogue use alternate cd and then use ice, it will run great

2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	maybe I'd by something if anything was available ;)
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	hjmills		how do i list the size of all the images in a folder in a list?
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	AidanL		I am guessing it is a bad thing.

2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	type "ifconfig" in a  terminal
2007-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	and ubuntu is debian based, using the gnome window manager, among others :)
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	let's see if ndiswrapper created any interfaces for it
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	MuffY	mwe	i mean, if you're just a desktop user there's not really a point in buying things that might be a bit better than the free ones, but which new features you're not going to use anyway
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	what you shoping for? hehe
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	crimsun	adam_	and is ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/*up.wav'' audible?
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	that's what i meant.
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	cntb		where in kUbuntu can I tune current color depth ?
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	bds		About USD $2000
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	I use linux only for my laptop but I keep windows on the desktop PC so I can play my favorite games
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	so what is sshd doing (or not) :}
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	binarydigit	hjmills	just the size or would using 'ls -la' do?
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	_Snatch_		can anybody help Tann to connect by wireless
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	Slart	hjmills	take some imagemagick.. add some bash magic and you're done =)
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	LinTux	Ubotu	could you give me the command again to put into console as my system crashed
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	AidanL	BHSPitLappy	There is eth0 and some writing and Lo with some writing. There are no bytes on the eth0 however there is a small amount of packets and bytes.
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	there is no good alternative for my favorite games. if you're satisfied with frozen-bubble you'll be ok though
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	failing before connection attempt.  may have something to do with xinetd.
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	AidanL		There is a small amount of packets and bytes on the Lo one - BHSPITLAPPY
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	try "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper" and then try again
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	pike_	cntb	for kde questions might get better answers '/join kubuntu' there
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	MuffY	mwe	yeah, i read gaming and linux don't go together (damn game developers), except if you have linux on your xbox :P
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	Slart	hjmills	there are probably easier ways though.. but I'm guessing that will work
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	maybe - log messages?
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	mwe	MuffY	right
2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	Tann	_Snatch_	fritsch was helping me

2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AidanL	eth0 is probably your ethernet, and lo is just loopback- your machine

2007-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	AidanL		I see.
