2015-05-07T02:48:05Z Zhivago: That sounds plausible.
2015-05-07T02:48:09Z freehck: Maybe it should be evaluated in something else?

2015-05-07T11:47:49Z freehck: To be more accurate: is the difference between `labels' and `flet' the same that is between `let' and `let*'?
2015-05-07T11:48:38Z freehck: I mean, if I use `labels', the next defined local function will know about the previously defined one. Right?
2015-05-07T11:48:51Z Shinmera: It's not the same
2015-05-07T11:49:00Z Shinmera: Any labels function will know about all other labels functions including itself.
2015-05-07T11:49:26Z freehck: So it could be defined recursively?
2015-05-07T11:49:31Z Shinmera: No?
2015-05-07T11:49:48Z freehck: Okay, I got.
2015-05-07T11:50:01Z freehck: But is there something like flet*?

2015-05-07T13:53:13Z Fare: however, if you use build-op with asdf:make, then you can specify :build-operation
2015-05-07T13:53:40Z Shinmera: Hrm, ok.

2015-05-07T14:28:25Z Fare: oh, my library doesn't do it, and I don't think CLON does either, though CLON makes it easy to have defaults from $ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES

2015-05-07T14:28:49Z Fare: for configuration files, you might want to reuse the uiop infrastructure
2015-05-07T14:29:25Z Fare: though the API of UIOP is being updated right now, with slight pathname incompatibilities on Windows.

2015-05-07T18:05:31Z Denommus: Bicyclidine: to create a Lisp, I mean
2015-05-07T18:05:42Z Denommus: Bicyclidine: we also need eval and quote, don't we?
2015-05-07T18:06:00Z Bicyclidine: lambda calculus is turing complete. if you want more than that, be more specific than "a lisp"
2015-05-07T18:06:20Z Denommus: I think I'm finding myself unable to form a proper question
2015-05-07T18:06:38Z Bicyclidine: that happens a lot with these minimization questions.
2015-05-07T18:08:19Z jasom: There are 25 special operators in Common Lisp
2015-05-07T18:08:31Z jasom: many of them can be implemented in terms of others though
2015-05-07T18:08:50Z Denommus: I remember an article describing that, to implement a new Lisp (including homoiconicity) there were a given number of special operators that must be implemented, and everything else can be implemented in terms of these special operators
2015-05-07T18:09:03Z Bicyclidine: there's more than one minimal set.
2015-05-07T18:09:09Z Denommus: IIRC, the author implemented this Lisp in Python

2015-05-07T18:09:29Z Bicyclidine: sort of like logic. you can implement boolean operators out of and, or, and not, or you can use nand, or you can use nor, or a few other things.
2015-05-07T18:09:32Z therik: Petit_Dejeuner, hey
2015-05-07T18:09:50Z dlowe: just because you've defined lambda doesn't mean you automatically have lexical binding

2015-05-07T18:22:44Z jasom: I suppose you could use a hash-table as well
2015-05-07T18:23:10Z jasom: Denommus: Note you will need a lot of functions as well as special forms.
2015-05-07T18:23:42Z jasom: e.g. there is no way to implement OPEN in terms of other lisp primitives
2015-05-07T18:23:49Z jasom: but OPEN need not be a special form
2015-05-07T18:24:36Z Denommus: hm, makes sense

2015-05-07T18:47:56Z cosmicexplorer: i've been playing with bouncing an AST from c/c++ source using libclang to a sexp and printing to stdout reading it into lisp
2015-05-07T18:47:59Z cosmicexplorer: it works for c programs, but on c++ programs the ast from just the standard header files is massive and sbcl dies of stack exhaustion
2015-05-07T18:48:30Z cosmicexplorer: this is because read is actually a recursive function; are there any iterative alternatives? i was half a hour into rolling my own but realized i might as well ask first
2015-05-07T18:48:37Z oGMo: cosmicexplorer: what for?
2015-05-07T18:49:13Z oGMo: if you're trying to convert C to lisp then probably not
2015-05-07T18:49:14Z cosmicexplorer: i'm trying to write a clone of http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?i=kmalloc and wanted to use lisp
2015-05-07T18:49:21Z jasom: whoa, eclipse generages *huge* call stacks; any invocation of funcall puts 32768 pointers on the stack.
2015-05-07T18:49:48Z cosmicexplorer: no i'm using libclang to get the ast directly and i have a wrapper program to convert that representation into a sexp
2015-05-07T18:50:37Z oGMo: cosmicexplorer: well, close .. i have c2ffi which does that but doesn't delve into definitions ... it's only meant for pulling declarations for generating wrappers
2015-05-07T18:50:40Z jasom: cosmicexplorer: you can keep track of your depth in the tree via a stack in a list or a vector
2015-05-07T18:51:02Z oGMo: cosmicexplorer: in theory you could extend it to read defs too for generating who-calls, if that's what you're after, but
2015-05-07T18:51:12Z cosmicexplorer: yeah that's the idea haha
2015-05-07T18:51:55Z cosmicexplorer: jasom: yeah i was about to do that i was just wondering if there was some builtin i could use instead of doing that lol
2015-05-07T18:52:11Z jasom: cosmicexplorer: it's probably possible to increase the stack size of sbcl
2015-05-07T18:52:26Z whartung joined #lisp
2015-05-07T18:53:08Z oleo: it is
2015-05-07T18:53:28Z jasom: sbcl --control-stack-size 64
2015-05-07T18:53:29Z oleo: but the total stack space exhaustion won't go away just by that....
2015-05-07T18:53:30Z cosmicexplorer: yeah there's an option you get if you run sbcl --help but for some reason that wasn't working for me, even when i tried using prlimit
2015-05-07T18:53:44Z oleo: if it is occuring systematically in your code.....
2015-05-07T18:53:49Z cosmicexplorer: it's just whenever the recursion gets 100 functions deep it dies
2015-05-07T18:53:50Z oGMo: if it's recursive and you don't catch it, no stack size increase is likely to help though :P
2015-05-07T18:54:06Z oleo: right
2015-05-07T18:54:06Z jasom: oGMo: he's traversing a very deeply nested structure; not runaway recursion
2015-05-07T18:54:19Z oGMo: probably shouldn't do that
2015-05-07T18:54:52Z oGMo: best to drop a reference to another record, and look at that when you need it
2015-05-07T18:54:55Z jasom: I already suggested keeping track of nesting off-stack

2015-05-07T18:55:08Z cosmicexplorer: yeah exactly just flatten the tree
2015-05-07T18:55:23Z oGMo: right but i'm saying you shouldn't look recursively _at all_, unless the declaration is in-place (which happens)
2015-05-07T18:55:51Z oGMo: mostly because why would you, though clang makes it a bit of a pain to tell
2015-05-07T18:55:52Z cosmicexplorer: yeah the recursion isn't from my code it's from calling (read)
2015-05-07T18:55:58Z oGMo: ah

2015-05-07T19:31:52Z ehu: whoa! why are lisppaste's pastes stored in XML format with multiple roots in a single file! That means hardly any other tools than lisppaste itself will read the files!
2015-05-07T19:32:48Z ehu has been working the last hours to find a suitable library to read them without being required to code it all over by himself
2015-05-07T19:33:03Z oleo: there are xml libs
2015-05-07T19:33:16Z oleo: cxml
2015-05-07T19:33:19Z H4ns: ehu: xml files cannot have multiple roots.  you need to wrap them in a root element or split at each root
2015-05-07T19:33:21Z oleo: for example
2015-05-07T19:33:36Z H4ns: oleo: cxml needs well-formed files.  a well-formed file has one root.
2015-05-07T19:34:00Z p_l: ehu: does the root element use an unique name?
2015-05-07T19:34:33Z ehu: p_l: nope. the first root is called "paste", but all further roots are called "annotation"
2015-05-07T19:34:39Z oleo: aaah
2015-05-07T19:34:40Z p_l: then it might be easy to split it with just awk. Or just wrap it around some bogus element for purposes of translating
2015-05-07T19:34:49Z p_l: ehu: still could work with awk :)

2015-05-07T19:35:21Z ehu: actually, that might be a really good idea. I'll strip off the xml version declaration and wrap the rest of the file in a new root.
2015-05-07T19:35:55Z ehu: I'll just copy the pastes somewhere else so I can process them this way and read them consistently.

2015-05-07T22:10:41Z ehu: hmm. with a bit of training it seems spambayes isn't able to cope with 15% of its input from the paste database. That's a pretty high percentage, I think. but with what it does do, it's classifying (correctly) more than half the pastes as spam.

2015-05-07T22:30:26Z ehu: dim: Sure, however, I think the solution that I want (a spam filter) is too many manyears away from what bare common lisp provides
2015-05-07T22:30:33Z ehu: although a SMOP, of course.
2015-05-07T22:31:02Z dim: yeah, just port (parts of) CRM114 so that you have a general programming interface to achieve that and more in CL?

2015-05-07T23:05:11Z ehu: hmm. ok. so, with my initial training, 20%+ gets classified as spam (that's 10% of the total paste set classified)
2015-05-07T23:05:42Z ehu: however, 10% of all pastes goes into the "Unsure" bucket, with ~300 pastes classified.
