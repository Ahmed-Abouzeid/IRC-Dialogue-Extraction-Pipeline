01:33:05 <sw2wolf> only CLISP reports such a weird error

01:35:25 <Bike> Error's from clx/dependent.lisp. Have at it.
01:36:51 <sw2wolf> CCL,SBCL and CLISP use same CLX from QuickLisp, i donot understand why only CLISP error ?
01:37:25 <sw2wolf> Bike: thx, i will have a look at clx/dependent.lisp
01:37:27 <Bike> It's conditionalized on the implementation.
01:38:38 <sw2wolf> In fact i donot understand the meaning of "Program tried to wait with no scheduler" ?
01:39:20 <sw2wolf> `(apply (timer-function i) (timer-args i))` should be a standard function call in CL
01:39:49 <Bike> If you'd have looked at the function in question, unmap-message-window, you'd notice that it calls clx functions.
01:40:02 <Bike> clx in turn does some nonstandard things with timers, etc.

01:43:21 <Bike> Yes. Maybe you could learn something by looking at the xlib functions.
01:44:28 <sw2wolf> then the problem is associated with CLX ?

01:49:42 <Bike> No idea.
01:54:29 <sw2wolf> By debugging, the error is caused by (xlib:window-map-state (screen-message-window (current-screen))) in CLISP ?

04:49:21 <p_nathan> why do you ask?
04:49:28 ahoops [~ahoops__@121.96.14.223] has joined #lisp
04:49:38 <dont_oracle> what do you think? I was perusing the section about perl regex vs lisp perl compatible rege and how lisps can be 2x as fast
04:49:46 <dont_oracle> that was interesting
04:50:06 <dont_oracle> I got a copy as a gift
04:50:17 <dont_oracle> but I am not a good enuf lisper yet to read it i think
04:50:23 <dont_oracle> I bought barksi land of lisp
04:50:37 <dont_oracle> since ansi cmmon lisp by graham kinda left me off the rails in ch4
04:50:49 <p_nathan> I think Mr. Hoyte is a bit over the top in his advocacy. I find LoL to contain very interesting approaches to scope management, and its a lesson and a thinking to read his macros
04:52:01 <p_nathan> I would agree that if you write your macros in such a way that it optimizes the generated code, you will get significant performance speedups.
04:52:04 farzi [~farzzz@1.38.26.43] has joined #lisp
04:52:27 <Bike> He does regexes through macros?
04:52:39 <p_nathan> It's also worth noting that fast code isn't written in Python/Perl/Ruby - their fast code tends to be FFI'd out to C libs.
04:53:05 <p_nathan> I suspect that pure interpreted dynamic languages are dog slow & memory hogs compared to SBCL..
04:53:19 <p_nathan> Bike: Hoyte breaks down some of cl-ppcre
04:53:59 <p_nathan> dont_oracle: Practical Common Lisp and a Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation are fairly traditional beginners books
04:54:45 <Bike> dont_oracle: The classic short intro on regexes is http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html, I think.
04:54:57 <dont_oracle> :)
04:55:03 <dont_oracle> ah yes the gentle intro

09:56:57 <sepi> I'm writing an irc bot using cl-irc. For this, I'm running the cl-irc mail loop which is a blocking call. What would be an easy library to use that would allow me to run the cl-irc mail loop in a separate thread so I can use my repl while the bot is running? I'm also using trivial-timers to repeatedly check and set a channel's topic
09:57:19 <H4ns> kiuma: i've never done that.
09:58:30 <kiuma> You can stay with sbcl and you can do whatever you want with MS and OO documents
09:58:53 <kiuma> OO server IRRC does not support threads
09:59:04 <H4ns> kiuma: how do i talk to oo server?
09:59:08 <stassats`> sepi: bordeaux-threads
09:59:31 <kiuma> H4ns, via socket
09:59:47 <H4ns> kiuma: what protocol?  is there a client library written in cl available?
10:00:01 <kiuma> H4ns, I don't think so
10:00:51 -!- ykm [~ykm@124.155.255.198] has left #lisp
10:00:57 <H4ns> kiuma: well, that, and the fact that oo is a pain to set up on headless systems makes me think that abcl + apache poi is not so bad after all, but thanks.

10:01:37 <sepi> stassats`: I was wondering if cl-async could help, but afaik it has it's own blocking main loop
10:01:49 <kiuma> H4ns, it was just to let you know since oo headless is sometime an hidden thing
10:02:17 <H4ns> kiuma: it is used by another group in my company to write letters.

10:03:06 <stassats`> sepi: why do you need to check the topic, though? the topic change is broadcast
10:03:32 <sepi> stassats`: actually I poll an mpd to update the topic
10:04:01 <stassats`> does somebody care what you listen to?

10:04:48 <kiuma> I let the user write using oepnoffice, then I've created an openoffice plugin (a toolbar button) that allows me to transmit the document to the server
10:04:56 <stassats`> anyhow, minion is run in a separate thread and it wakes up every minute, if it's not woken up by messages, to check if it is still connected
10:05:03 -!- Tanami [~carnage@9ch.in] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
10:06:06 <stassats`> that's the code which does that: https://github.com/stassats/lisp-bots/blob/master/irc-bot/connection.lisp
10:06:37 <kiuma> the docuemtn comes from the server in open format, where I set hidden variables inside the document. This way the document is transmitted to the server with its metadata.

10:08:00 <antonv> hi
10:08:14 <stassats`> it uses iolib to do wait-until-fd-ready, cl-irc uses usocket, but you can still get the underlying fd from the implementation
10:08:33 <sepi> stassats`: it's a bot that controls the mpd which plays the music for a room full of nerds. They care what's playing

12:26:04 <Ralt> (let ((x 1)) (* x 2))
12:26:10 <Ralt> this is the construct to be used ^

15:25:06 <wakeup> Fare: Well I cant go ito specifics about inferior-shell. But when I considered using it I got scared off by its dependencies and lack of modularity. I have now a DSL that executes commands, and a macro for generic piping.

15:27:56 <wakeup> it is documented, not released
15:28:45 <wakeup> but its really simple, basically its just a macro SH, invoked like (SH symbols "strings" (expressions) $variables ...)

15:55:02 <wakeup> stassats`: I take it you are genuinely interested, excuse me for my rudeness. Basically both fare and I implemented pipes in CL. When you run an external program in CL you have to decide what type the stream is going to that the external program writes to.
15:56:20 <wakeup> when you choose binary, which isn't even an option in some impls as far as I remember, then you need babel or similar to get the characters, when you chose characters, you cant pipe e.g. gzip
15:56:51 <stassats`> wakeup: so you're putting the data through lisp even if you just connect two different processes, as in, a | b?
15:57:16 <wakeup> stassats`: yes because that way you can also connect precesses and lisp functions

18:25:23 <mooglenorph> My motivation: I need to take a grad-level compiler course and a grad-level os course, requirements for my phd
18:25:48 <mooglenorph> I could probably use contributions to a bare-metal lisp as a project for both courses.
18:26:04 <stassats`> minion: movitz?
18:26:05 <minion> movitz: No definition was found in the first 5 lines of http://www.cliki.net/movitz
18:26:48 <mooglenorph> Problem being that I have basically no experience with this level of programming, I'm mostly in theoretical CS and statistics. But lisp is my favorite language for writing random stuff in.
18:26:56 <mooglenorph> Thank you for the pointers.
18:27:23 <p_l> Xen might be easier target, but you still will have the thing that gave nyef problems
18:27:50 <p_l> namely how to make the device-handling code (and other such critical sections) be in appropriate places in memory etc.
18:28:24 *mooglenorph* nods
18:28:35 <mooglenorph> I will dig through these notes and try to familiarize myself with SBCL.
18:29:05 <mooglenorph> Which is the lisp implementation I use anyway... I've never looked into the source before, though.
18:30:03 <stassats`> sbcl source is not really directly comprehensible
18:30:28 <mooglenorph> Heh. Is there a "guide for noobs"
18:30:55 <stassats`> step 1: become not-a-nooob
18:30:57 <mooglenorph> Or maybe I would be better served by trying to port a simpler lisp to Xen?
18:31:17 <stassats`> no current CL implementation is simple
18:33:18 <mooglenorph> I meant not a CL, I guess. More tractable, but certainly less interesting.

18:35:39 <flip214> mooglenorph: how about simply putting a lisp as an init-process on eg. linux? would solve all the hardware-abstraction, only "drivers" to the tty and so on need to be written.

18:38:49 <mooglenorph> basically, leads to some fun architectural problems.
18:39:23 <mooglenorph> So, good for a project to pursue across a couple classes for someone who likes distributed computing & lisp. Unless it isn't really tractable, in which case I'll need to find something else to do...

20:20:41 <schoppenhauer> Hello. Is it possible to declare a precise function type in sbcl? I declared (optimize 3), and it complains about not being able to optimize a funcall.

20:30:43 <antonv> about IPyton, it was interesting to see in their video presentation how they discovered (evolved) into archtectrure where sever-side part interacts with client via protocol (like swank/slime in Lisp)

20:32:13 <antonv> cddr: previously (I heard) there was enother solution, ILISP or something like this
20:32:29 m7w [~chatzilla@178.172.204.109] has joined #lisp
20:32:49 <antonv> (if it was really called ILISP, this is one more analogy to IPython)
20:33:53 <antonv> fe[nl]ix: this line makes the test working from terminal?
20:34:34 <gendl> so in emacs24.2 on Windows, Slime splits the screen when you start it, and takes only half the screen,
20:34:43 <gendl> in emacs 23.3, it doesn't do that.
20:35:02 <gendl> is that intentional?
20:35:06 <ehu> gendl: so it's working better in 24.2? :-)
20:35:21 <gendl> is it supposed to split the screen?
20:35:45 <fe[nl]ix> antonv: yes, running mp::startup-idle-and-top-level-loops
20:36:15 <fe[nl]ix> antonv: but when run from within slime, it presents the same faulty behavior
20:36:26 <Xach> When I used ILISP, I had problems keeping the communications in sync.
20:36:30 <Fade> gendl: I think it's probably safe to assume the behaviour is not accidental.
20:36:40 <Xach> I think that was partly because I used a very new and untested implementation, SBCL.
20:36:51 <wbooze> does (/= 1 2) => T mean both are unequal ?
20:36:55 <wbooze> numerically....
20:37:11 <Xach> wbooze: /= returns T if no pair of its arguments are =
20:37:26 <gendl> Fade: so I guess it just doesn't quite work as intended on 23.3 on Windows and 24.2 is working better.
20:37:35 <Xach> scratch that!
20:37:43 <Fade> I assumed it was an enhancement when I first saw the behaviour.
20:38:07 *Xach* double checks and find he was right the first time
20:38:14 <Fade> on my machine, it only seems to happen on an emacs frame that is wider than N, where N is > 1/2 screenwidth
20:39:07 <Fade> I use stump, so if I have emacs in a window frame that takes up half the screen, slime starts in the whole frame. if the emacs frame takes up the whole width of the monitor, it splits the frame.

20:40:28 <Fade> if you don't like it, I'm sure you could alter the behaviour by configuration, although I don't know offhand where/how.
20:40:43 <gendl> and if the emacs window is taller than it is wide, slime splits the frame horizontally instead of vertically.
20:41:00 <antonv> fe[nl]ix: I mean if it fails in general, let it fail in my machine too
20:41:21 <fe[nl]ix> antonv: but it doesn't fail in general
20:41:31 <fe[nl]ix> only sometimes, and I don't understand why

20:49:42 <schoppenhauer> omg. I would have expected displaced arrays to be pointers to the same memory area. but at least under sbcl, this does not seem to be the case.
20:49:46 <antonv> bordeaux-threads docs say condition-notify tries to wake up only 1 thread
20:50:12 <fe[nl]ix> antonv: ABCL hangs on that test, which SBCL passes

21:04:51 <antonv> fe[nl]ix: I was wrong about previous results for ABCL and CCL - the very table I posted above contains TIMEOUT for ABCL and CCL
21:05:05 <antonv> fe[nl]ix: so it fails _sometimes_
21:05:40 <antonv> but ECL previously didn't have any failures
21:06:39 <antonv> fe[nl]ix: for the future development of bordeaux-threas, I support what pkhuong said yesterday: if the API provides only one function of contition-notify and condition-broadcast, it's better to chose condition-broadcast
21:06:51 <antonv> fe[nl]ix: or provide both
21:07:45 <antonv> notifying only one thread is suitable for rare cases, typically we want to notify all the threads

21:34:48 <wbooze> so all that goes unrecognized ...until you try...
21:35:16 <pjb> schoppenhauer: well,  since those pointers are bigger than an address, they involve a double indirection.  Depending on the benchmark, this may explain it.
21:35:23 <wbooze> unrecognized and without effects....
21:35:30 <schoppenhauer> pjb: maybe the more interesting question is: can I prevent bounds checking?
21:35:34 <pjb> schoppenhauer: notice that most CL functions have :start and :end parameters.
21:36:16 <pjb> schoppenhauer: implementation dependant.  But (declaim (optimize (safety 0) (debug 0) (speed 3))) may let an implementation skip the bound checking.
21:36:31 <schoppenhauer> pjb: ok
21:36:47 <pjb> schoppenhauer: but I fail to see the point of using a CL compiler if you do that: just use GCC.
21:37:35 <antonv> pjb: I saw the Death Start kickstarter beginning, didn't know they finally collected $350,000 :)
21:37:38 <schoppenhauer> pjb: it is a time-critical part. and I hate using cffi. even though it would probably be better.
21:37:40 <pjb> I'm of the school that says that assertion checking should be left in production code.
21:38:08 <pjb> schoppenhauer: then go with the declaim.  Also, try to use simplier CL functions.
21:38:16 <schoppenhauer> pjb: ok
21:38:17 <pjb> eg. svref instead of aref.

22:35:05 <antonv> If speak about Core, there is also Lisp dialect called Shen. It is implemented that way. There is a minimal core, called K-Lambda, containing 46 functions. Everything else is defined on top if it. This allows to bootstrap the language on top of many platforms: CL, Ruby, Javascript, etc.
22:35:12 <antonv> K-Lambda description: http://www.shenlanguage.org/Documentation/shendoc.htm#Kl
22:37:06 <pkhuong> antonv: how's performance?

22:39:23 <antonv> pkhuong: on the other hand, I believe it is possible to achieve decent performance with this approach
22:40:50 <antonv> in any case, If speak about CL, there are definetly parts for the spec, which are just library written in Lisp, so shaping these parts as library will not affect performance
22:41:48 <|3b|> yeah, going the other direction (implementing bits of CL in some subset of CL) is easier
22:42:05 <antonv> and only improve it if all sevaral implementations will reuse the library and join efforts in polishing it, instead of repeating each other's work defining cl:set-difference, cl:set-exclusive-or, cl:remove-if-not
22:42:36 <pkhuong> antonv: for performance reasons, there's a lot of knowledge about these in SBCL's and CMUCML's compiler.
22:43:01 <Bike> with remove-if-not you have imp-defined extensions like sequences

22:44:12 *|3b|* isn't sure that follows
22:44:27 <Bike> I mean, you could have one library that has r-i-n for vectors and lists, and one that does the extension, and they'd be incompatible.
