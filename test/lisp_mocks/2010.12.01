17:35:47 <attila_lendvai> Fade: same here. but we also have a tendency of looking at the code of anything that doesn't work as good as we would like it to work... and slime fell pray for this tendency of ours, because we work quite a lot with it.
17:36:40 <Fade> well, after sbcl/ccl/cmucl etc. I guess slime is probably the most important package in the free lisp ecology.
17:36:41 <attila_lendvai> every time there's some recurring annoyance in the tool I'm using, e.g. slime, then I open a varying, but not so long session to fix it.
17:37:18 <Fade> marco's slime movie was the thing that brought me back to lisp.
17:37:23 <stassats> that's the same reason i became a slime developer/committer/whatever-it's-called-nowadays

17:38:17 <attila_lendvai> stassats: yeah, most of the slime comitters think like that. except Helmut...
17:38:36 <Fade> is the issue that helmut doesn't accept patches? or is it just a style issue?

17:40:36 <attila_lendvai> Fade: he uses slme in a simple way, and he cries out regularly for keeping the slime codebase simple to minimalize his maintainership load. (but he fails to see that he's driving away several people who would be happy to help maintaining an evolving slime...)
17:40:55 <attila_lendvai> stuff like the fancy inspector and the repl are very typical examples of this

17:41:32 <Fade> normally i'd say that forking is a sane thing to do, but forking a critical lisp system also forks a fairly small number of eyeballs.
17:41:34 <attila_lendvai> a useful inspector is key in a managed environment like lisp. now it's in a contrib which is not loaded by default...
17:42:19 <Fade> I've been loading 'slime-fancy for almost as long as I've been using slime.

17:47:36 <Fade> I guess that's why the 'slime-fancy contrib was defined.
17:48:45 <Fade> perhaps a formalised plugin architecture for slime would be something that could get plugged in upstream.

17:48:55 <Fade> it sounds like the current situation is somewhat haphazzard.

17:52:39 <stassats> formalizing means maintaining a stable API, but slime doesn't even have releases, so that's not an option
17:53:01 <Fade> it seems to me that quicklisp is likely to change that culture somewhat.
17:53:10 <stassats> unless somebody is willing to step up and do slime release management

18:39:47 <pepone> i whant to map the states of a connection
18:40:26 <stassats> symbols have identity, if you're using enums for identity
18:41:39 <pepone> mm but you can asign any symbol, the point of using enums is that the range of values is limited

19:26:06 <necroforest> err, intialise
19:26:32 <jimrthy> necroforest: I just tried it. I don't see that symbol in that package either.
19:27:01 <necroforest> i just see load-library, init-ttf, and a few other related ones
19:27:54 <jimrthy> ttf-font.lisp has an "initialise-font" method, but it doesn't seem to be exported. Not that I know enough about packaging or system definitions to have much of a clue

20:11:21 <seangrove> If I have a macro in package "vana", and it creates ~3 functions, but I want to use it in another package "lash" so that the 3 functions will be created in (and exported from) the "lash" package - is this the default behavior?
20:11:29 <seangrove> I keep thinking it is, but then packages turn around and bite me
20:11:53 <Hexstream> Make the macro take 3 args which will name the functions.
20:12:54 <Hexstream> Well, that would be the most conventional and safe way. You could also use INTERN to create the names in the current package.

20:15:08 Phoodus [~foo@174-17-245-93.phnx.qwest.net] has joined #lisp
20:15:16 <Hexstream> Well then, INTERN without a package arg creates symbols in the current package. So if you invoke your macro from the lash package and the macro uses INTERN with 1 argument, then the symbols will be created in the lash package.
20:15:29 <seangrove> very cool, that makes a lot of sense
20:15:30 <Hexstream> So what's the question then?
20:15:46 <seangrove> ... or my brain has just been twisted beyond being capable of recognizing sensible things
20:16:00 <seangrove> The question was just where the symbol would end up being interned
20:16:14 <Hexstream> Ok, so I guess I answered that. :)
20:17:20 <Hexstream> You can verify what package a symbol has been interned in with SYMBOL-PACKAGE.

21:48:54 <Bronsa> (defun lol () (print *load-truename*))
21:49:02 <Bronsa> if I do
21:49:18 <Bronsa> (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'lol) (lol)
21:49:20 <Bronsa> i get nil
21:50:01 <Bronsa> i need to get "/home/[user]/lol/lol.lisp"
21:50:11 <Bronsa> and I can't understand how to do this
21:50:28 <gigamonkey> Ah, never mind, that's not going to be the .lisp file, that'd be the .fasl file.
21:50:42 disumu [~disumu@pD4B9E0C8.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #lisp
21:51:14 <Bronsa> there is no way to do it, maybe using some eval-when dark magic?
21:51:21 <gigamonkey> There's also *compile-file-truename*
21:52:02 <gigamonkey> What happens if in your file you do an (eval-when (:compile) (setf cl-user:*my-location* *compile-file-truename*))

21:54:09 <Bronsa> I get an ubound marker (?)
21:54:55 <gigamonkey> Yeah, defvar cl-user:*my-location* before you do it.
21:54:57 <gigamonkey> Sorry.
21:55:24 <gigamonkey> You still haven't answered my question though, what are you really trying to do. I.e. why do you need this information?
21:55:26 <_6502_> hello: what's wrong with "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-mandelbrot" :executable t :toplevel #'doit)" ? the resulting program keeps starting the standard REPL instead of calling (doit) ...
21:55:55 <Bronsa> gigamonkey: I'm trying to make stumpwm ./configure free
21:56:28 <Bronsa> and I need to know the source dir to be able to know where the contrib dir is
21:58:14 <Bronsa> nothing changed
21:58:33 <Bronsa> (defvar *my-location*) (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) (setf *my-location* *compile-file-truename*)) (print *my-location*) => #<unbound marker {52}>
21:58:45 -!- b-man_ [~b-man@189.34.55.65] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
22:00:00 <gigamonkey> Try this: (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) (defvar *my-location* *compile-file-truename*))
22:00:46 <gigamonkey> That may not by 100% right if the compile-time environment is different from the runtime environment.
22:00:55 <Bronsa> I get an "Undefined variable: *MY-LOCATION*"
22:01:09 <gigamonkey> From a DEFVAR?!
22:01:32 <Bronsa> seems like the defvar is not executed
22:01:39 <gigamonkey> What Lisp?
22:01:42 <Bronsa> sbcl
22:01:51 <gigamonkey> And you did a compile-file?
22:02:22 <Bronsa> wait.
22:02:34 <Bronsa> I do this (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'lol) (lol)
22:02:57 <gigamonkey> You probably need to do compile-op
22:03:32 <gigamonkey> Or add :load-toplevel to the eval-when and change *compile-file-truename* to (or *compile-file-truename* *load-truename*)
22:03:41 <gigamonkey> The latter probably being better.
22:03:58 <gigamonkey> Though, like I said, this is still not, I don't think, guaranteed to work.
22:04:09 <gigamonkey> But it may work in practice.
22:04:23 <_6502_> hmmm

22:10:19 <gigamonkey> Bronsa: in general it seems like the right thing is to copy files from the source directory to wherever the fasls end up. Then you can use *load-pathname* at load time to find things.
22:10:27 <gigamonkey> But maybe that will be just as much of a pain.

15:03:04 <pjb> mason: this is often the default choosen for memoizing libraries.
15:03:20 <mason> pjb: really?
15:03:49 <pjb> mason: Yes.  Notice that hash-table may behave badly on lists, when the test is not :eql.
15:04:54 <mason> pjb: mmmmm
15:04:57 <mason> pjb: unfortunate
15:05:01 <pjb> Now, for 2-element lists we could expect from the implementations to deal with them correctly, but specific time complexity is specified.
15:05:49 <stassats> mason: i was referring to the default hash-function of hash-table being EQL

15:11:20 <tcr> I'm wondering what it is that creates sb-posix.fasl, though? Might that be what the :pathname option in a defsystem does?
15:11:54 <stassats> EOF-sensei: i can't make any sense out of your question
15:12:07 <tcr> EOF-sensei: Because you also write f(x) in maths
15:12:36 <EOF-sensei> but you don't write (+ 1 2)
15:12:42 <stassats> but i do
15:12:48 <EOF-sensei> i'm sure
15:13:16 <tcr> EOF-sensei: In Lisp, + is just a function; it's a design decision
15:13:27 <stassats> because i don't want to write "+" n times, because i don't want to memorize all precedence rules

15:14:18 <stassats> although, in smalltalk you can write 1 + 2, and not memorize different precedence rules
15:14:49 <stassats> but it becomes confusing
15:15:33 <EOF-sensei> i'll stick with C and Python
15:15:42 <pkhuong_> EOF-sensei: good stuff.

15:23:33 <Guthur> umm does Lisp often get recognized as a GNU system language
15:23:52 <Guthur> maybe I'm reading 'system language' wrong
15:24:31 <Krystof> the original gnu manifesto said that the gnu system would be progammable with C and Lisp
15:24:33 <Krystof> I think
15:25:06 <Krystof> "Both C and Lisp will be available as system programming languages."
15:25:27 <froydnj> Xach: there's not much difference between git and releases...maybe a little for ironclad
