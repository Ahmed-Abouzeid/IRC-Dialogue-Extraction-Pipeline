2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	cybercod		if ubuntu has a driver for it that isn't working, you'd need to blacklist it before using ndiswrapper
2007-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	I want to navigate the contents of that partition from the terminal, what should i enter cd /media/hdb1? or what?
2007-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	ok that works! now what i want to do is create a mount point in my home directory for that hdb1 partition, how do i do that?
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	cybercod		create the folder first
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	cybercod		then its in fstab...
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	i have created a folder called mkdir ~/windowsPartition
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	cybercod		i think its sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	what do i do in fstab?
2007-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	i simply want to manually mount the windows drive
2007-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	cybercod		you'll see the current entry for the fat32 partition just change the path there
2007-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	cybercod		if you want to manually mount it you can use Disks
2007-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	cybercod		just make the folder first
2007-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	cybercod		if you can't create a folder in /media then hit Alt+F2 then type in gksudo nautilus
2007-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	i want to manually mount the partition hdb1 to a folder called ~/windowsPartition
2007-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	cybercod		Kenthomson... get to know the utility called Disks.
2007-01-01T12:32:00.000Z	cybercod		come in there jason with the MondoLinks!
2007-01-01T12:32:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	i thought there was a simplec command like mount <partition> <mount point>
2007-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	cybercod		jame1... you could just reboot... or Ctrl+Alt+Backspace may do it... there's probably a mount command but I don't know it
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... i'm sure there is... i'm just familiar with the gui... i'm learning the command line little by little
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	cybercod		i'm not a guru in here or anything
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	cybercod		just slightly ahead of the curve
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... shoot
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	one more thing, i want to access System>administration>Disks, but the item disks is not listed, moreover from edit menus also there is no entry for Disks under Administration, how do i get that utility?
2007-01-01T12:49:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... try sudo disks-admin in terminal
2007-01-01T12:49:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	one more thing, i want to access System>administration>Disks, but the item disks is not listed, moreover from edit menus also there is no entry for Disks under Administration, how do i get that utility?

2007-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... put it in quotes... it can't handle the space in Program Files
2007-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	cybercod		mmzin... it wouldn't show up as steam.. it would show up as wine or cedega
2007-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	cybercod		kenthomson... did you get wine to work right with that?
2007-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	yeah wine worked, but i cant configure shockwave to work correctly, can you help?

2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	cybercod		you need to be logged into the live disk to do this... narf
2007-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	cybercod		you wouldn't... apt-get will download it... problem is
2007-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	cybercod		problem is you won't be able to talk to us because of your errors
2007-01-01T03:01:00.000Z	cybercod		and coming back in here will nullify getting mined because it will just be in ram-drive
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	How do i access Ubuntu's (on HDD) FileSystem from a Ubuntu LIve CD?
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	cybercod		so wait
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	cybercod		lemme get you more instructions first
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	assume liveCD is running and Ubuntu FS (the one on HDD) is on hda1
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	cybercod		cancel out the CTRL+ALT+F7 part
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	cybercod		then you're gonna type in             sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	cybercod		next you'll type in            sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	How do i access Ubuntu's (on HDD) FileSystem from a Ubuntu LIve CD?
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	kenthomson	cybercod	assume liveCD is running and Ubuntu FS (the one on HDD) is on hda1
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	cybercod		and at this point you should be able to hit CTRL+ALT+F7 and get graphical interface back up with the new drivers
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	cybercod		once you are at this point you should be able to install like normal... though I'd appreciate it if you start up GAIM and come tell us if it worked before starting the install.
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	cybercod		did you get all of that kitsune1?
