2007-01-01T04:04:00.000Z	Maheanuu		I fought over the softraid bios and the softraid from Ubuntu for over 2 weeks
2007-01-01T04:05:00.000Z	LameBMX	Maheanuu	and what was you outcome
2007-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	LameBMX	Maheanuu	yea search wiki for fakeraid ...i had to use the long howtoo and the quicky fakeraid edgy one ... and mix them up ...
2007-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	Maheanuu		No prob's, I had been pulling my hair out for 2 weeks until I finally managed to find the various how to pages for setting up raid, I am building a raid5 array for storing video etc on and need the speed and large space
2007-01-01T04:09:00.000Z	LameBMX		oh yea Maheanuu i remember ya now ... personally for vid work i would have bounced between a couple raid 0's and left the 5th for storage
2007-01-01T04:09:00.000Z	LameBMX		i readfile from on raid 0 ... writefile to other raid 0 :)
2007-01-01T04:10:00.000Z	LameBMX		hey sukarn i wasnt helpin adaptr was helpin ya .. i just butted in for a quick second cuz i saw you didnt know about raid and didnt want ya to toaste something elses

2007-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	Maheanuu		how true, Lame...  I just like raid5 over all the others, having been using in under windoze all these yrs
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	Maheanuu		When Ubuntu first made it's debut, I watched in awe of its humanitarian goals and ideals...  I started handing out warty discs to everyone I ran into at home, and even made a convert of a nephew who was attending our university and working on a degree in puter science, today he is a linux guru and wouldn't change for anything...
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	LameBMX	Maheanuu	i was playin around with vista .. and about a week or so ago a saw a vid of beryl ... havnt looked back since lol
