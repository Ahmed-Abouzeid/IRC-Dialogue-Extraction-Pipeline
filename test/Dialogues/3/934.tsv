2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	m12		how do you change window managers?  I just downloaded one, and then restarted X.org, but i'm still in gnome now.
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	select options at the login screen?
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	m12		ohh ok, i thought that was a gnome login screen.
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	it is, but you have options. :)
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	m12	n2diy	then how do i change back if i don't like the new one?  will it have a login screen that is similar?
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	I don't know, but I would think so?
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	n2diy	m12	It is probably defaulting to gnome?
