2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	dom_		i was really hoping to get this resolved right now though
2007-01-01T02:41:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	does the card show up at all?
2007-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous		hmm...
2007-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous		what's iwconfig give you?
2007-01-01T02:42:00.000Z	dom_		shows the ESSID and the mac of the AP (that's how i know i'm connected)
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	do you have link quality and bit rate???
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	dom_		link quality = 52/94 and bit rate = 54mb/s
2007-01-01T02:43:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	and ifconfig gives you an IP address?
2007-01-01T02:44:00.000Z	dom_		i'm on my laptop right now
2007-01-01T02:45:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	dhcp or static?
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	dom_		actually, i've tried both... dhcp right now
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	any other computers on that router?
2007-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	dom_		+ dhcp
2007-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	did you lock down the router config? (I.E. MAC filtering or something?)
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	turn off the blacklisting for a minute and see if that helps
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	tried it earlier
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous		no luck?
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	nope
2007-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous		using WEP or WPA?
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous		OHHH....
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i don't think it's a router problem, as i can connect my laptop fine, i can connect my desktop fine in freespire, and right now, i can't even ping 127.0.0.1
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	get Network Manager...
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	got it
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous		.0.6.3?
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	auTONYmous		(version number)
2007-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i've tried configuring w/ the gui, configuring from command line... nothing helps...
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	well, if you're getting and IP assigned, then you're getting past WEP and MAC filtering...
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	...right...
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	and nm-applet is showing connected?
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	dom_		yup
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	ping your own IP
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	dom_		can't
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	100% packet loss
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	when i ping localhost -> ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	never seen THAT before...
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i know, right? it's insane....
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i'd chalk it up to a hardware issue... except that it works perfectly in freespire
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	are you using some firewalling?
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	dom_		iptables is installed but i have no rules setup
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	I assume you're PLANNING to use it...
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	and if i setup eth0 (the hardline) i can ping around and do whatever
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	auTONYmous	dom_	stumper...truly
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	damnit

2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	dom_	auTONYmous	i even tried deleting /etc/networking/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf in an effort to start fresh
