2007-01-01T08:35:00.000Z	Zyphern		So I select DHCP from the network settings dropdown list but it still doesnt work
2007-01-01T08:35:00.000Z	Zyphern		Do I have to install ubuntu to my hdd for the internet to work
2007-01-01T08:35:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	I have the same problem I have to use dhcpcd to fix it
2007-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	Zyphern		which requires installing it to hdd right?
2007-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	I would think so, but you maybe able to install it to ram if you have enough memory
2007-01-01T08:39:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	no just run synaptic as root and find it in the list it is a one click install like most apps in ubuntu
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	installing dhcpcd does yes
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	Zyphern		well theres an issue :)
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	not using it though
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	Zyphern		How am I supposed to fix my internet not working, when what I have to do involved using the internet
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	that is if you install to hdd
2007-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	sorry i forgot you are on live-cd
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Zyphern		how can I set up dhcpcd without using the internet?
2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	kd7swh	Zyphern	the only way you could install dhcpcd without network con. is by storing to deb (install) file on another cd or something
2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	kd7swh		the deb*
2007-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	Zyphern		ah okay
