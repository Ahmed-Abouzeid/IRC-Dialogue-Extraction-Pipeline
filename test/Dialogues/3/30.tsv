2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Innomen		hi all. trying to put ubuntu on a thinkpad 600, it says invalid compression error 2 and kernel panic is there a way to simply install it to the drive without ahveing to load it into memory or some other work around?
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Asc	Innomen	Yes, use the alternate install CD.  But I can't promise it'll work any better when you go to start it.
2007-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Innomen		any ideas anyone?
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Asc	Innomen	It should be around the same place you find the normal CD.  I'll try and locate the page, but my internets are slow.
2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Innomen		thank you very much :)
