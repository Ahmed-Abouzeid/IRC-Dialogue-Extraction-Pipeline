2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Not here, vimtutuor is a tutorial on how to use vim
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It has a little bit of a learning curve
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	ah, on the internets?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	i don;t mind

2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY		i just want something to write code in
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It is very similar to vi, which should be installed on any unix like machine
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	MuffY		with syntax highlighting and such
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Emacs or Vi/Vim are both good choices for writing code
2007-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Syntax highlighting, code folding, etc.
2007-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	I prefer vim, but as mwe pointed out it is a personal preference
2007-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	MuffY		(i installed ubuntu about 8 hours ago, so i'm a bit new =))
2007-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Open a terminal and type 'vimtutor'
2007-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	MuffY		yay!
2007-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	or to cut to the chase type 'vim'
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	MuffY		it's just a terminal window :/
2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	That is the learning curve part
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	you shouldn't ask me =p
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It does, you need to se up your .vimrc file

2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	from a terminal type the following 'vim ~/.vimrc'
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	When vim loads press 'i' to insert
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Type or paste the options you want

2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Those setting will now be loaded everytime you start vim
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	MuffY		w for saving, q for quit
2007-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	np :)

2007-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Vim is different in that it is modal
2007-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	Meaning you are either in edit or read only mode
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	MuffY	bds	that sucks :p
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	bds	MuffY	It is tough to get used to but some people seems to like it
