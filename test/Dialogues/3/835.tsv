2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	marelo		i've just installed unreal tournament in my laptop (running kubuntu) but the game is too slow... what could the problem be?
2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	that you're running kde
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	i'm afraid I didn't get you
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	the problem is that you're running kde. it's big. it's bloated. and it chews through memory with ease.
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	what's the stats on your laptop?
2007-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	512 RAM, Pentium M 1.73 Ghz 2 MB Cache
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	sounds like my thinkpad. yeah, kde is definitely going to slow you down. have you thought about using a replacement wm? xfce? icewm? *box?
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	no... didn't though of it yet... i think kde is the most beautiful... well, actually i think enlinghtment is more beautiful, but still beta....
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	well, kde and gnome are notorious for bloat.
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	marelo		and i'm running the game alone... nothing else running... i runned on windows xp with 256 mb ram in a 16mb video card... i don't think kde is the problem...
2007-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	hardware acceleration problem? with the graphics card? maybe wine is emulating the graphix card via software. what card do you have?
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 04)
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	and i'm not using wine
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	the game is linux native too
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	have you tried running unreal in windows on that same system?
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	no... here in my laptop i only have linux! =] 
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	marelo		windows only in my desktop
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	sorry, don't know how to continue from here. but I think it has to do with the way wine utilizes the graphic capabilities of your video card
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	i said some lines ago, i'm not using wine. the game is linux native
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	maddash	marelo	sorry - that's what a I meant. how the linux subsys interacts w/the graphics card...
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	marelo	maddash	humm ok then. thank anyway for your help/time
