2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	mdke_		hi there. What's the best way to use a signature on emails with thunderbird? I've looked around and it seems like I need to put it in a separate file??
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	binarydigit	mdke_	this isnt the thunderbird channel
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	mdke_	binarydigit	I'm aware of that
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	mdke_	binarydigit	do you deny assistance to people who use Ubuntu on the basis that this isn't the $program channel? if so, no one would get any help
2007-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	binarydigit	mdke_	you are asking a program specific question , you would proably have better luck in a place that is geared towards it, its not like you are asking a general ubuntu question
2007-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	binarydigit		but shoot yourself
2007-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	mdke_	binarydigit	charming. This is a help channel for users of Ubuntu, let's hope someone else uses thunderbird here
