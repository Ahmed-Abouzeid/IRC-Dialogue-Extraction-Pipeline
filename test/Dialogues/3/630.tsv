2007-01-01T09:22:00.000Z	kane77	DarthLappy	I know... I was not thinking about linux for I pod... but more of a portable version...
2007-01-01T09:23:00.000Z	DarthLappy	kane77	Oh, I know what you mean now :) I just woke up, so excuse that.

2007-01-01T09:24:00.000Z	DarthLappy	kane77	It might be a bit slow to try and run something Ubuntu-sized...  There's always DSL for small Linux fun :D
