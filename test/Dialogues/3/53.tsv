2007-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	Argoran		can anybody help me with xchat?
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Argoran	lots of people here use it - just ask your question, you should get help...
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Argoran		thank you BHSPitLappy
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	Argoran	are you running the real XChat, or the awful & useless XChat-Gnome?
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Argoran	Madpilot	its the gnome version
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Argoran	ick. Ditch that, use the older, better XChat. Xchat-gnome has some sort of goofy popup user list that can't be configured.
