2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cyclonus	It is a known fact that Cedgiga stole from wine
2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	Cyclonus	Jordan_U	- provide some pointers
2007-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cyclonus	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedega
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Cyclonus	Jordan_U	- have you actually read and understood that article?
2007-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cyclonus	I understand that it is not technically stealing because they are obeying the licesnce that wine was under, but it was still in my opinion wrong
2007-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Cyclonus	Jordan_U	- it is not stealing in *any* sense
2007-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cyclonus	#ubuntu-offtopic if you want to discuss further though.
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	Cyclonus	Jordan_U	- if developers are too lazy to read and understand the license they use, they shouldn't publish their stuff. as far as i can see wine does not complain. only GPL fanatics complain but it's not a GPL issue, it's not illegal and not immoral either. blame the wine developers, if you want to blame anyone

2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	Cyclonus		in fact it's quite unethical to spread such rumours
