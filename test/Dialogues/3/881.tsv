2007-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	hacked`		cause like i have a directory called test, and in that dir, there are subdirs, and in each of those subdirs i have a dir called specific, is there any way that to use grep to find files like .tlg in the specific dirs?
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	mnoir	hacked`	look at the R option
2007-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	hacked`		see what im saying, i just want to search /hi/*/specific/*.tlg*
2007-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	mnoir	hacked`	that is simple:  grep -R string *.tlg
