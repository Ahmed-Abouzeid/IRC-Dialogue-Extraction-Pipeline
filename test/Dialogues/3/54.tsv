2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	BHSPitMonkey	about leetspeek, you mean?
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Madpilot		and you'd be back to the multi-CD installs other distros have
2007-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	pretty much. That u r 2 4 crap makes my eye twitch.
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	BHSPitMonkey	unless Edgy's installer has changed things, you can still order Ubuntu to install w/o swap
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	just basing on what I heard a few minutes ago from someone.
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	Madpilot	I've never tried to omit one
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	BHSPitMonkey	when I had to reinstall Dapper I did not set up a swap partition, the installer complained once, then worked fine.
