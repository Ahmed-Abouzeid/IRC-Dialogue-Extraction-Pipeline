2007-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	derrik	gan|y|med	the same as your mysql username and password
2007-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	gan|y|med	derrik	and how are these?
2007-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	gan|y|med	derrik	sorry, cannot google right now for the defaults in ubuntu
2007-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	derrik	gan|y|med	You first need to add a mysql user and then you can use the username and password that you create to log into the phpmyadmin that you installed.

2007-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	derrik	gan|y|med	ahh. socket in var is wrong again? i don't understand. but as long as it's working now
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	gan|y|med	derrik	mysql.sock points to the wrong file i think. i'll fix that. but thx a lot
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	derrik	gan|y|med	no problem
