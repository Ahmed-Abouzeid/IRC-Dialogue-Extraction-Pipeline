2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	khaije1		has anyone had success using ssh for arbitrary tunneling?
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	yes
2007-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	but i cant remember how to do it off the top of my head :/ been long time
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	i haven't been able to figure out what I'm doing wrong, I'm trying to use the -D option for dynamic (socks-style) forward proxy tunneling. In my case it's mostly just to evade corporate content filter
2007-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	give me a second while i look at mine. i havent used it since high school XD
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	if anything comes to mind, could you PM me? i need to go afk, back in 10 mins :-)
2007-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	yes :)
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	erf. i have a sunblade 150 and i have solaris on it
2007-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	that's with putty
2007-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	oh ok, that is the exact equivalent of what i'm doing...
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	you did that and it doesnt work?
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	khaije1		did you need to change any sshd settings? ya...
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	h3xis		nope
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	h3xis	khaije1	have you taken into account that your corp has port 22 blocked?
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	khaije1	h3xis	it's not that, straight ssh is fine, i can do X-forwarding as well
