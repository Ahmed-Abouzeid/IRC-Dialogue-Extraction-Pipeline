2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	I got here late...what's the issue with the touchpad
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	the touchpad does a region select on the desktop instead of moving the cursor.
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	As if it were double clicking a place on the desktop that corresponded to the place I touch on the touchpad.
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	do you know the touchpad manufacturer and model # (Synaptics or otherwise)
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	No, I've been looking, but haven't figured out how to find it out. There are no system specs with that information online either.
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	dmesg should tell you...
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	sweet, is that all of the devices on my system?
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	auTONYmous		whatever got loaded at startup...if not, then /var/log/Xorg.log will tell what driver its using
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	I've tried lspci to find the touchpad and the monitor, the closest I have come is the display adapter.
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	auTONYmous		check /var/log/Xorg.log
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	What would it be described as, Touchpad? Pointing Device?
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	auTONYmous		Input device
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	is Xorg.0.log the same?
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	auTONYmous		yeah
2007-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/127/
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	your touchpad isn't synaptics
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	No, I think the other system I used had a synaptic.
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	auTONYmous		I think Xorg is picking up your touchpad device as a Wacom tablet, so its working wrong
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	Look into System -> Administration -> Device Manager and look for your touchpad device
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	k
2007-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	Nothin, there are a bunch of unnamed things on the PCI and USB bus though.
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	auTONYmous		look for PS/2 entries
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	and 2 generic mouse/ps/2 devices
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	Generic, eh?
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	Yup, checking detailed info.
2007-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	nothing identifying the manufacturer
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	dmesg|grep input
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	k
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	also: dmesg|grep PS
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	it reports 2 generic mouses (mice)
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	(The second one gave me the mouse device ID)
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	no device ID, I see input ID Input2 and INput 4
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	what's the make/model of the laptop
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	Panasonic Toughbook CF-18
2007-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	this too PNP: PS/2 Controller [PNP0303:K101,PNP0f13:MOU2]  at 0x60,0x64 irq 1,12
2007-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	heh, I wanted one of those...
2007-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	I got a good deal on ebay
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Anderson	auTONYmous	no luck with the justineclarke site
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	I'm at a loss. It appears your touchpad IS synaptics, but the xorg drivers don't support that particular model
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Anderson	you might be stuck with a USB mouse
