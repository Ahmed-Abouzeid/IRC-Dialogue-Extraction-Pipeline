2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	maddash		for the record, having gparted in the edgy installer is a HUGE mistake. the textmode installer from breezy and dapper were just fine...so developers, if you're out there, take heed.
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	yeah the text installers were great, they were very intuitive I thought, but I guess some couldn't use them
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	you can always use the alternate isos
2007-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	I guess...but then I'd have to spend 1.5 hrs dl-ing one iso only to find out that i need another.
2007-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	no you wouldn't, you would know get the alternate iso
2007-01-01T07:36:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	well, then again, I'd never dl edgy...no lts.
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig	maddash	are you on server or something
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	why?
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig		I mean how much support do you need
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	bruenig		If they support for 18 months, I am going to stop using edgy in 6 months anyways, so not a big deal
2007-01-01T07:38:00.000Z	maddash	bruenig	oh. let me rephrase. well then again, I'd never dl edgy. i'm caveman.
