2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	bjames_		hi all, firstly sorry for the stupid question, but does anyone know if I *need* to install an X server on a machine that's only going to be used via Xming logon?
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	bjames_		Bloodhunter: can I recommend a more appropriate channel?  try /join nvidia
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	bjames_		/join nvidia without the quotes
2007-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	is that Ubuntu-specific ?
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bjames_		just an idea
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	well, IIRC Ubuntu has some builtin logic to help you do this, so why not Google for it ?
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	it's at least 3 times easier than using nvidia's guidelines...
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	?
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	you have to do at least 3 distinct things to get the vanilla nvidia binary to work, and Ubuntu pretty much does them for you
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	bjames_		I've installed Nvidia drivers before - the best place I found was form the Ubuntu getting started guide, but that's just my experience
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	indeed, but it differs enough from the official nvidia way that newcomers probably don't want to be confused by it
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	what was it ? :)
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I have Ubuntu server set up running SSH and SAMBA as a fileserver - do I need to install an X server on the machine in order to run graphical programs remotely (via Xming)
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I asked this over in xorg, but none of them knew exactly
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	ah I see it - well, you *need* the libraries so that X clients can connect to your remote X server, and AFAIK they're only fully installed when you do the full Xorg installation.. you should just go with xorg and tell it not to start up a local X server automatically
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	cheers, I'll try and figure out how to do that
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	it is mnore relevant to tell your display manager (xdm, gdm, kdm) to do the right things, like A. not start the local X server, and B. open up XDMCP to network requests
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	have you had any experience with Xming?
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	so, gdm config, not so much Xorg config
2007-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I tried it a while back, and if you just set an Ubuntu desktop to allow remote X, it works pretty much out of the box... haven't had that much luck with a remote server though
2007-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'm pretty much a newcomer, so to be clear I need to    1) install x- server?    2) somehow edit the startup scripts(? ) to prevent it starting into gdm
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	halfway there.. you do need to install X, yes - it's called xorg-server or something, but you do want to start a display manager - it just should not start  the X server.
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	ok
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	connecting to a remote X machine is done with the XDMCP protocol, which is part of the display manager - gdm in Ubuntu's default case
2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	bjames_		in which case does it matter which I choose?
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	(it'll probably be gdm)
2007-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	a little more technical: it is actually gdm that tells the X system to use the local X server as the users' display - but it could as well be a remote display
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'll tell you the whole story, just for clarity.  I'm thinking of setting up a fileserver and at the moment I've installed Ubuntu server 6.06 on VMware and had a play
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I'm running 606LTS as a file/web/mail/whatever server here, it's a beaut
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	what I want ideally is a minimalist install on hardware but that I can log into using Xming
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	that =kinda contradicts itself.. you won't have a minimalist install when X is possible
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	it was easy enough to set up so I'm happy with it so far on VMware - will be moving to hardware in a week or so
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	do you know what hardware ?
2007-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well temporarily a PIII 450, 1G RAM 40G HDD
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	1GB of ram is in-sa-neey :)
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	mine has 256, and it uses about 160 of that with samba, Postfix, apache, mysql, named, mailscanner etc. running
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well I don't know what to do relaly my *main* PC (Windows box) has an AMD x2 3800 3G RAM 400G HDDs so I was going to doneate some RAM from that
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	not possible, believe me
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I might not donate any RAM at all as I have 128 + 256 sticks on the PIII mobo
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	a P3 uses single rate SDRAM, at 133MHz max., while an AMD 64 uses DDR SDRAM at 266MHz minimum - they're not ecxactly compatible
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	to be honest I've not looked at the RAM to see if they are compatible so probably
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	bjames_		oops
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	384 is  more than enough for the foreseeable future
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	good good
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	things you *do* want in a server are: 1. ECC memory, if you can get it, and 2. redundant storage.
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	1. is a nice option to have, but 2. is non-negotiable - use a mirrored system disk at least
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	the thing is I was thinking of long-term - I kind of want a system with RAID (when I feel brave enough) and I was wondering if it's possible to have it spin down the HDDs so they don't get too much wear and then use a large RAM buffer and only spin up the HDDS when needed
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	RAID requires no courage - only money :) if you use Linux softraid it works fast, simple, and very very dependably
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	for a server, spinning down the HDs is not an option.
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	yeah I've heard it's faster than hardware RAID in most cases
2007-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	bjames_		RAID 5 would be ideal
2007-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	well, it's obviously not, if you use decent hardware.. but it is a lot less expensive, and it can combine drives from any type of interface
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	the last one is really the most important - if you get, say, 4 drives on a 4-drive RAID card, then that's it - you cannot expand beyond it, and if you decide to put in another 4x card then you'd get 2 arrays at best - with softraid you just set up all 8 drives to give you RAID 10 or 5 or 50 or whatever
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	whether RAID5 is ideal really depends on what you're going to use it for
2007-01-01T03:31:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	in terms of pure storage, yes - it is
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well I like RAID 5 as a balance between fault tolerance and speed, however thinking about it striping (RAID 1?) might be better as it'll be accedd over a wireless network therefore wont need the speed
2007-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	bjames_		accessed*
2007-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I've read a bit about RAID and it seems simple enough to set up in Linux
2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	basically I want a VERY reliable box that I can sit in a cupboard and not worry too much about, but I'd like to be able to compile stuff with it every now and again
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	yes, md raid is very easy to set up - you can even let Ubuntu server do it for you while installing
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	bjames_		Hawkev: how cheap is cheap though?  I think software RAID is probably right for me
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	that's what I did - mine is running off 2x 36GB ultra160 on an adaptec card
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	bjames_		you see that's not really cheap compared to what I'm looking at shelling out for the rest of the HW
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	if the choice is between Linux md RAID and a fakeraid card, forget the card - it's useless
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	a *real* RAID controller will start at around $300, for 4 SATA channels
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	exactly!
2007-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	but that will also give you on-board cache RAM and battery backup - which is a little more than you need for  a home setup
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I can get an SATA mobo for 30 (~$45) and software RAID a lot easier!
2007-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I thought you already had the board ? you mentioned a P3 450 somewhere back
2007-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	bjames_		RAID = redundant array of inexpensive disks - it's a way to either make your storage FASTER, MORE RELIABLE or both
2007-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	here's the evolution of my fileserver - VMware setup to test (current), PIII 450 hardware (next step - when I get back to the flat), hardware X (when I get round to upgrading so I can use SATA HDDs possibly)
2007-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	how much time between step 2 and 3 ? if it's less than say a month, it might not be worth the trouble
2007-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	at the moment I'm a Windows user and want a file store with some provision to play with Linux
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'll probably install a minimal X-install for now and use the PIII hardware with my current PATA drives
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	bjames_		thanks one and all for the info/advice
2007-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	if all you want is a fileserver, why use X at all ?
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	well this is something I'm arguing with myself, part of me wants a graphical logic from my Windows box so I can sort of ease myself into Linux (I've only ever dipped my toes in the Linux water and found it to be tepid at best, although it's getting warmer)
2007-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	bjames_		login*
2007-01-01T03:46:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	(I've tried VMware - which I love, I've also dual booted, but found the sheer number of partitions can be a hastle when windows dies and decides it wants to reclaim the HDD behind my back, etc)
2007-01-01T03:47:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	if you manage to set up an X login to your server it will grant you almost no visible benefit.. it is nothing like Windows in any way
2007-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	as a simpel home file and internet server, linux is far superior to windows
2007-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	no, no, I mean I want something that allows me to get more used to Linux in a transition from Windows completely
2007-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I run mine ona dual P3 server system because I can.. because I have it, not because it needs the hardware
2007-01-01T03:49:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	and I am trying to explain that having a GUI on a Linux server will not help with that transition in the slightest
2007-01-01T03:49:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	whilst being useful in the mean time
2007-01-01T03:49:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	why not?
2007-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	because.. it is *nothing like* Windows
2007-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I want to get used to the Linux alternatives to Windows programs so I can transition between the two - I'm not looking to make Linux into Windows, I think we have crossed wires at some point
2007-01-01T03:51:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	I understand that, and for that, you can start by running Ubuntu in a vmware host to get used to it. But for a server, things are altogether completely different
2007-01-01T03:52:00.000Z	bjames_		and is normally only prodded via SSH or similar for maintenance
2007-01-01T03:53:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	exactly.. and - perhaps contrary to your intuition - you are going to have to *start* there in order to have a swinging chance at getting a *graphical* server to work...
2007-01-01T03:53:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	start from a graphical Desktop install?
2007-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	adaptr	bjames_	of course you can do that, but it will need significantly more hardware
2007-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	bjames_	adaptr	I'm going to try installing the desktop version on VMware and see how I get on with remote desktop then balance my thoughts and decide what to do, cheers for the help
