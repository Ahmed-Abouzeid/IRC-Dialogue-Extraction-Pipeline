2007-01-01T08:35:00.000Z	mino789456	Lynoure	my problem is that it worked until update, non-free driver fglrx and I try 8.28.8driver from ATI website too, and of course I try open-source, but non of them worked with 3D acceleration :(

2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	mino789456		and I dont know what version of Ubuntu, but I installed Dapper, how could I know what version of Ubuntu I have?
2007-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	Lynoure	mino789456	You updated to edgy? I had heard of that happening and did not do it (that being one of the reasons). Sorry, maybe someone else knows what to do
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	mino789456	Lynoure	no its Dapper, 6.06.1 LTS, so how can I install the FOSS driver, remove fglrx and install xserver-xorg-video-ati, as arrenlex advice me?
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	Lynoure	mino789456	arrenlex usually gives good advice, so go for it.
