2007-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	mwe	adam_	#ubuntu is a good place to get help with that ;)
2007-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	adam_	mwe	thats what I was hoping... I'll have a look at some links and see what I can do.
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	mwe	adam_	people are usually helpful in here. crimsun is _the_ sound guru. I don't think he's around right now though
