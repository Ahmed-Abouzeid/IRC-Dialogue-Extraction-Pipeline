2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	jeffbrown		when I explicitly invoke hibernate it seems to work.  I have configured my power prefs to hibernate when the lid is closed.  When I close the lid the machine does not hibernate.  Any tips?
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	is that a thinkpad?

2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	consider installing ibm-acpi or something

2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	you can usually config ubuntu to hibernate w/a  script
2007-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	jeffbrown		I am puzzled because hibernate appears to work, it just isn't triggered when I close the lid
2007-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	have you installed acpid?
2007-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	yes, acpid is installed
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	in a cmd-line, issue sudo gedit /etc/acpi
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	/etc/acpi/ is a directory
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	ach sorry. do ls /etc/acpi/*
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	there are a bunch of .sh files there
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	sorry about the delay. there's supposed to be sh file.
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	there are a bunch of them
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	do sudo gedit /etc/acpi/actions/lid.sh
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	done
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	when you close the lid, the linux kernel will execute the contents of that script
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	ok... I will experiment with that a bit and see what I can figure out
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	so i assume you want to hibernate when lid is closed. ergo, type in hibernate command into the lid.sh.
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	do you know what files are manipulated when I click the button in power management UI?
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	huh ? what management ui?
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	System -> Preferences -> Power Management
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	sorry, can't help you there. I didn't do a standard install of ubuntu. and I don't have gnome
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	jeffbrown	maddash	thanks
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	maddash	jeffbrown	anytime
