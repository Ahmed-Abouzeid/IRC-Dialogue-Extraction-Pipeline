2007-01-01T08:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	With what card?
2007-01-01T08:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	The FOSS radeon driver will give you accel on that.
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	I never heard of that, FOSS, that another ati driver? could you give me a link?
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	You have it. It's part of xserver-xorg-video-ati
2007-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	My own radeon card started getting 3D acceleration when I upgraded to edgy, but you have an older card.
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	You can try using the radeon driver to see if you get acceleration. Install xserver-xorg-video-ati if you don't already have it, and change your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to use the radeon driver. If you haven't modified it, you can use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and select radeon instead.
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	I will try it, thanks, perhaps it will work
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	hm, I tried to install package xserver-xorg-video-ati, but there isnt this package, I tried to search it via Firefox search engine for ubuntu packages with no luck too :(
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	oh! You said you were running dapper. *headsmack*
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	You may already have it then. Give me a moment...
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	yes, but I think there isnt this package, I search it with synaptic too
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	Don't worry, it's because you're running dapper.
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	Does the file /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/radeon_drv.so exist on your system?
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	NO
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	Ah. In dapper, it's called xserver-xorg-driver-ati
2007-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	Insatll that.
2007-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	arrenlex		It's so amusing that the acronym is coc.
2007-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	ok, I find it with synaptic, I ll be back in a moment :)
2007-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	mino789456	arrenlex	just a small question: Isnt it bad that I havent this file you wrote?
2007-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	mino789456	No. That package will install it.
