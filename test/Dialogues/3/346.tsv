2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		hi! I have Ubuntu Drapper installed and my wireless card shows up in the networking app. Yet I'm not able to connect to the local wireless router
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	what did you use to attempt to connect?
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		the networking app that comes with drapper
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	and is your wireless router using WEP or WPA or no encryption?
2007-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	there is no encryption
2007-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	ok, open a terminal and type sudo iwlist scanning and tell me if it sees your wireless router there
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		Ib see 4
2007-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		all say Interfernce doesn't support scanning.
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	hmm....ok, i guess there's still some problem with drivers or something
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	what type of wireless device?
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	so what? install ndiswrapper?
2007-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	I'm not sure
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe		IEEE 802.11b/g
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	ohhh....broadcom.  this should be interesting ;)
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	ok, hold on, let me find some URLs on ubuntuforums.org for you
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	its an inspiron 1150 laptop
2007-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	i think all we need to know is that it's a broadcom 4306

2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	that seems to be for your wireless adapter
2007-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	unfortunately this type of wireless adapter seems to take more effort than others
2007-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	yeah I'm used to ndiswraper...its all I ever used
2007-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	doviende	Commander-Crowe	if everything's working, you should be able to see the card in iwconfig and you should be able to scan with iwlist
2007-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	Commander-Crowe	doviende	ok...right now I'm using the eth0 connection
