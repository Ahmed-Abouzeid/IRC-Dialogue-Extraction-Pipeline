2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	cybrjoe		anyone know of a media sharing app similar to the new winamp remote stuff?
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	what does the winamp thing do?
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	does it let you access your mp3 collection remotely?
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	cybrjoe		Duncal, yea, not NAT setup or anything
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	no* ... you just point your browser
2007-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	that's what mp3tunes.com does i think; you upload your music collection and then it lets you play/download it from any PC
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Dunca1		(without software on the other PCs, you just goto the website)
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	yea, i'm still not convinced its a good idea to upload all my music to a remote server
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	i was looking for a more local solution
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	dont know of anything then (i'm here 'cos I can't get mp3tunes to work with ubuntu properly, despite having linux support...)
2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	do you have your entire collection up there?
2007-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	Dunca1	cybrjoe	yep
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	cybrjoe	Dunca1	check your pms
