2007-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	Core		no one works
2007-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	no better than having one that doesn't work, then
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Core		I have debian
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	nope, it's 2.6.15-27
2007-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	Core		With Turbo Linux too, it seems
2007-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	I know - I told you, and that's what I have running
2007-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	and Edgy has 2.6.17, so you'll have to take a look at Feisty
2007-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	Edgy? Feisty? Codenames?
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	yes
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	release names, actually - dapper was 6.06 (june 2006), edgy is current, 6.10 (october), feisty is next, due out in april or something
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	so 6.10 doesn't works yet???
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	of course it works - what do you mean ?
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	i have to wait the next release?
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	well, like I said, you can try Feisty now - but it is on serious beta
2007-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	or try one of xtknight's kernels, if you;ve been paying attention at all
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	lord_ceiphas said kernel 2.6.17 doesn't works with JMICRON-PATA
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	adaptr	Core	no he did not - he said repeatedly that 2.6.17 does not work with the core 2 duo
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	Core	adaptr	and 6.10 has this kernel? right? or higher?
