2007-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	HawkeV	bjames_	buy yourself a cheap raid card from newegg
2007-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	bjames_		Hawkev: how cheap is cheap though?  I think software RAID is probably right for me
2007-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	HawkeV	bjames_	a cheap card starts at $70
2007-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	HawkeV	bjames_	what are you going to use the box for?
