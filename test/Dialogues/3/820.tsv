2007-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	maddash	they both suck.  stick with Xorg though, it comes with Ubuntu
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	maddash		awoslappy: why do they suck? what doesn't suck? and I did a server install of ubuntu, so I can go w/either, I thnk
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	maddash		awoslappy: I'd be happy with a link you can provide
2007-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	maddash	well XFree86 is not compatible with a lot of hardware, and Xorg eats memory.
2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	maddash		awoslappy: what doesn't suck? aqua? explorer.exe?
2007-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	maddash	as of yet they ALL suck.
