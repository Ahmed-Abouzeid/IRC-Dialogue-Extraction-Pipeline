2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon	yes in time
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	elyon		But its not something I need to consciously go to a website every  now and then and check...
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig		well it is automatic, just not immediate
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon	no, it will show up in the update manager
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	elyon		Okay... and the actual update is automatic?  Or does it require a tutorial to do it? :P
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	bruenig	elyon	no, in ubuntu there is a little icon that shows up in the panel when you have an update, and you click on it and install them
