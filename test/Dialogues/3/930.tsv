2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	what editor?
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	for latex?
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		yeah
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	emacs
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		ah
2007-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	with the acutex package
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	not necessarily
2007-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	well I know the kubuntu-desktop installs a lot of krap. I suppose that's the difference then ?
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	Kubuntu uses KDE, but if you used Ubuntu and installed KDE, it wouldn't be Kubuntu
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	what if I installed ubuntu then kubuntu-desktop?
2007-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	isn't the default window manager the only difference?
2007-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	kubuntu is just a packaged distribution... to say that just having KDE is having Kubuntu, it to say that running GNOME means you're using Ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	difference between ubuntu and kubuntu is that ubuntu installs ubuntu-desktop whereas kubuntu installs kubuntu-desktop instead
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	right, after a base system
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	which they both install
2007-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	identically
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	mwe	kubuntu-desktop includes KDE, tailored the special ubuntu way, with all the things that make ubuntu ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	ubuntu-base is the same
2007-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		right
2007-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	mwe	BHSPitMonkey	AFAIK installing kubuntu-desktop and removing ubuntu-desktop from a standard ubuntu install gives you exactly the same as if you installed kubuntu in the first place
