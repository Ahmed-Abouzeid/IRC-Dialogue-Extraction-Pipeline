2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	I have 3 lines for the mount points and 3 for the partitions
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	maddash	Mike_	I'm confused. what do you mean 3 lines?
2007-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	maddash		or she?
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	I am still confused (sorta still a n00b) I just dont want to make a mistake and trash windows
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Mike_		ok.. I have 22.26 gig of free space
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Mike_		on the mount points.. I don't see the 22 gig
2007-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	it says no root file system
2007-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	with the free space I created an extended partition (hda3) which is 22gig then there is another partition hda5 that is unknown and is also 322 gig
2007-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	I am trying to make the 3 gig for swap and it is giving me an error
2007-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	maddash		for the record, having gparted in the edgy installer is a HUGE mistake. the textmode installer from breezy and dapper were just fine...so developers, if you're out there, take heed.
2007-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	hang on a sec
2007-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	wish me luck..
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	Mike_	maddash	half way thru copying files
