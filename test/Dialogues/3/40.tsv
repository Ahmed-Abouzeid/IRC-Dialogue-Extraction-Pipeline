2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	Jowi	ChesMan	kiba-dock_0.1cvs20061018-1_i386.deb is the only one that I have been able to get working in Dapper (never tried edgy)
2007-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	ChesMan	Jowi	i tried Pricechilds that he has listed on the forums, everyon in the thread seems to be getting it to work, even after a reinstall it doesnt work .. :( lol
