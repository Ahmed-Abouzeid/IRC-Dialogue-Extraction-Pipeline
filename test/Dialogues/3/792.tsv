2007-01-01T04:14:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas		its a bluetooth-mouse, but is recognizes as a usb-mouse... the logitech mx1000 laser
2007-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lord_ceiphas	i've had problems with PS 2 mice being detected properly, but never USB.  Maybe try a PS2 adapter
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	lord_ceiphas	IndyGunFreak	yes.. ill put the bluetooth-hub into a ps/2-adapter.... im sure this wont work
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		oh you're running it through a hub
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	lord_ceiphas	i thought the mouse was directly plugged intot he PC.
