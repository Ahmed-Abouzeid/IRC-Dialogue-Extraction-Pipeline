2007-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	l33t		I already installed that package via Package Manager
2007-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	oh, you need to edit your xorg.conf still?
2007-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	l33t		I did that and it gave me an error

2007-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	l33t		but I didn't change that first thing

2007-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	l33t		this room is too damn crowded
2007-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	step 1, install java (it's called j2re in synaptic), step 2, pick limewire or frostwire (they're identical, frost is just open source, no ads or nags), step 3, depends on your choice.
2007-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	l33t		I want frostwire
2007-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	then get frostwire from apt-get or synaptic
2007-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	l33t		it's not in the package manager
2007-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	have you enabled universe
2007-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	l33t		opened
2007-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	open synaptic, go to Settings>Repositories, and then check all the boxes.
2007-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	l33t		too much chat
2007-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	we've all been highlighting you, our instructions should be in red.
2007-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	l33t		so what do I do in Synaptic?
2007-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	open synaptic, go to Settings>Repositories, and then check all the boxes.
2007-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	l33t		I did that
2007-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	then close the settings window, click the Reload button, then look for frostwire
2007-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		I'm really not convinced, but that's fine.
2007-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	l33t		update?
2007-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	the RELOAD button at the top in synaptic
2007-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	l33t		why dont you believe me
2007-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	if you still can't find it, then go to frostwire.com and get it there.
2007-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	we don't believe you because we can all see it there.
2007-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	l33t		I checked all of them
2007-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	see if they're still checked. Maybe you did something wrong and they didn't stick
2007-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	l33t		they are still checked
2007-01-01T08:27:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	just download it from frostwire.com
2007-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	l33t		done installing
2007-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	uhh... run it and get pr0n?
2007-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	l33t		it doesn't require java?
2007-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	what?
2007-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	l33t		Frostwire doesn't need java?
2007-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	l33t	of course it does, it's written in java.
