2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	you need an mp3 lib, or easier, just install vlc :p
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	nn531		k  becasue when I do xmmc it doesnt find any packages
2007-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	use the command sudo apt-get install vlc
2007-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	nn531		and that's really starting to get annoying
2007-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	vlc is a media player, it'll do mp3s
2007-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	couldnt find vlc

2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	nn531	jasin	k, I was wondering why you gave me the debian page
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	the instructions are this: 1. sudo apt-get update 2. sudo apt-get install vlc vlc-plugin-esd 3. sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	nn531		jasin:i cant update, not connected to the internet, dial up wont work with ubuntu
2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	jasin	nn531	well you'll have to go online to install mp3 support, there is no mp3 support natively
2007-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	nn531		k

2007-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	jasin		stormx, if they have the libraries installed, yes.
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	jasin		stromx, umm no, you need the mp3 library to playback mp3s
2007-01-01T05:51:00.000Z	jasin		stromx, no way around that
