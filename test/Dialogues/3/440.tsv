2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	h3xis	bruenig	if i wanted i could get the code from adobe
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	no you couldn't
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	unless you have some sort of inside there, like you are a developer or something
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	h3xis	bruenig	you sure? i was told you could a long time ago when macromedia owned it
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	bruenig	h3xis	you can't get it, I am sure, look at things like gnash, if you could just get the code, there would be no gnash
