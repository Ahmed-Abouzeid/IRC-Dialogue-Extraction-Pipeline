2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	brianMan	DarthLappy	That irssi doesn't show the quit/join spam doesn't mean it doesn't still get the data (which lags some people off) :(
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	DarthLappy	brianMan	That's true.  But there has to be some way...
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	DarthLappy		(To get the data to the users)
2007-01-01T03:27:00.000Z	brianMan	DarthLappy	I'm sure it's possible to make the server silently remove people when it's a netsplit and silently rejoin them on merge
