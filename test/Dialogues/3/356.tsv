2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	it comes through the update manager
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	elyon		Okay... and the actual update is automatic?  Or does it require a tutorial to do it? :P
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	familiar with the update manager? the orange square in the notification area?
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	elyon	BHSPitMonkey	- vaguely familiar... it's popped up a few times for me to update software.
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	the orange square will light up in the notification area, by the clock.  you'll click on it, put in your password, and see the updates at hand.
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	from there you can re-check, or click Install Updates
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	elyon	for kernels, it will tell you that it won't take effect until after a reboot
