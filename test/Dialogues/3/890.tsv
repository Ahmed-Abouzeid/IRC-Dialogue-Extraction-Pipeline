2007-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	adaptr	mnoir	your system won't die because of a memory leak.. it will just start killing processes
2007-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	adaptr	mnoir	well, the oom-killer will properly log what it's doing
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	mnoir	adaptr	I agree that you are free to not use swap.  before deciding not to take advantage of very cheap insurance, ya might want to google 'need swap in linux?'  and read some technical opinions  :)
2007-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	adaptr	mnoir	what technical opinions ? I never said I don't want or use swap.. boy you're easy to bait :)
2007-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	mnoir	adaptr	naa - just adding to the general discussion.  I am one of those old fashioned types who prises reliability and, therefore, uses swap, anti virus, multiple firewalls, etc.  Of course - the icestorm poweroutage just got me anyway :)
2007-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	mnoir		but....
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	mnoir		is admin defined in yout sudoers file?
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	mnoir		yout=your :)
2007-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	adaptr	mnoir	Anderson: I am a member of both adm and admin, they should definitely be in there
