2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	hepme		does shareware exist in the linux world, or only completely free or completely commercial?
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it's all free
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	hepme	h3xis	i mean from 3rd party people
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it's still free
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	right
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	hepme		not all software for linux is free though
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it is all free
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	h3xis		but price is a diff subject
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	hepme	h3xis	well you're wrong on that count too since there are some linux things that dont come with source code, such as blobs :P
2007-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	hepme		considering that many are completely GUI users
2007-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	gotta learn somehow XD
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	hepme		why does lsb_release say 'no lsb modules avaialble'
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	hepme		and now everyone is just a little frsutrated. irc is not a word processor :p
2007-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	hepme		is Synaptic package manager a product of GNOME or is it ubuntu specific? I ask because it allows you to manage repositories but not all linux distros use apt-get like repositories yet can still run GNOME
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	it was developed for debian
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	hepme		what other s ystems besides debian and ubuntu/kubuntu use debian like packages
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	h3xis	hepme	xandros i think
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	hepme		whats a strong coffee? coffee with mountain dew in it?
