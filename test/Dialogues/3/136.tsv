2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	IdleOne		Happy New Year All! what is the command to reconfigure xorg? least I believe thats what I need to dio because everything on my screen is way to big
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	explain too big
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	adaptr	my icons on desktop are about 2 times the size of what they were yesterday morning
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	how does this relate to your screen resolution, i.e. what is it ?
2007-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	adaptr	resolution is 640*480 right now and I cant seem to change it. dont have other options
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	then something has screwed up your xorg config - you can force a reconfig by running sudo Xorg -configure from a console, but it won't be perfect
2007-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	unless you've disabled DDC on xorg, in which case it won't be able to get the resolutions from you rmonitor
2007-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	adaptr	I didnt disable anything
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	well, try one or the other ways of reconfiguring your xorg.conf first, then see what it puts in the config file
2007-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	adaptr	IdleOne	for any control over screen resolutions and refresh, you'll have to hand-edit xorg.conf anyway
2007-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	adaptr	Music_Shuffle thanks for your help screen back to normal now :)
