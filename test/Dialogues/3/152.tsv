2007-01-01T03:52:00.000Z	alecjw		we can only tell warty people to upgrade
2007-01-01T03:53:00.000Z	adaptr	alecjw	uhm.. why ? is breezy an LTS release then ?
2007-01-01T03:54:00.000Z	alecjw	adaptr	it's not been completely discarded yet... only warty has. we can tell hoary people to upgade when feisty's released
2007-01-01T03:55:00.000Z	adaptr	alecjw	advising people to upgrade has very little to do with whether it's still supported, in  my view - Ubuntu is heavily under development, and even Dapper will have many advantages over breezy, whether breezy is EOL or not.
