2007-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	grndslm		could somebody explain why fullscreen videos over GooTube work on my friends computer, but not the other 3 computers running Edgy that I own??
2007-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	kitche	grndslm	maybe you don't have flash installed
2007-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	grndslm	kitche	i wouldn't be able to see the videos period if it wasn't installed...it's just fullscreen that's the problem
2007-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	grndslm		All 3 of my computers won't display YouTube & Google Videos in fullscreen mode, but when i upgraded my buddy's computer to Edgy, his fullscreen button works!!  What gives??
