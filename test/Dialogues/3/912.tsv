2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	magic_ninja		its supposed to be an OS that is completely compatible with windows
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	no such working thing exists by now though
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	supposed to maybe ...
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	why do you say that?
2007-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	i was reading it, they had it up and running a few basic apps on older hardware
2007-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	yeah a few basic apps. I don't remember the name. it's been there for several years. still doesn't work with 99.9 of all programs

2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	i might actually try it on my laptop to see how it goes
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	yes that's it. reactos
2007-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	it's a good idea. but in 5 years or more most things still don't work
2007-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	give it time
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	I will. gave it 5 years so far ;)
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	looks to me another microsoft in fostering trying to leech off the public
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	they used to say it was open source
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	yeah
2007-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	well right now its still open source, but they are making a corperation out of it
2007-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	mwe	magic_ninja	that's often how things turn out. sadly
2007-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mwe	however i do predict that that company will have some legal battles with microsoft, it'll be sco all over again
