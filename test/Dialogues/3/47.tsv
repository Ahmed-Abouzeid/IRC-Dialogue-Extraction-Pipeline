2007-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	HawkeV	LameBMX	no, the way umask works
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	LameBMX		and HawkeV is more likeyly right im a n00b and just goin but guesses based on what ive fiddled wit
2007-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	HawkeV	LameBMX	basically, umask=022 would give root r/w, but no-one else
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LameBMX		like i said HawkeV ... if something dont work the first time ... i just try different things till it does (after backing up of course)
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	HawkeV	LameBMX	i like that method of learning =)
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LameBMX		or in the case of xorg almost have memorized
2007-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LameBMX		yea .. i remember things better lol
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	LameBMX		all this talk about how stable nix is .. and i crash my box about 10 times a day ..
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	LameBMX		yea i understand
2007-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	LameBMX		crap about 3 years ago when i got my first computer ... windows installs didnt last a day
2007-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	LameBMX		i could prolly resurrect about half of those now but dont really matter its how i learn
