2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	jasin		security patches have to be downloaded
2007-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	they don't have to be downloaded seperately in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	if their not included on the cd they do.
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	they get installed with the software the requires them when you apt-get it
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	my point is you don't need the cd in ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	not if you have internet and use apt-get
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	jasin		try sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	yeah what about that?
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	it works fine
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	apt-get downloads its how it gets every update.
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	its still downloading them its just ussing apt-get to do it
2007-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	because the updates are integrated
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I know. I said you don't have to download the patches SEPERATELY
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	no their not, apt-get goes to repositories, thats where the security patches are from.
2007-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	no their not, apt-get goes to repositories, thats where the security patches come from.
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	of course it goes to the repos and dont repeat
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	what's your point?
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	blah, you are arguing semantics
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	talk to someone else
2007-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I'm not buthead
2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	jasin		i'm a student so I have tohave a working word processer and abi-word seems to be the best in linux but it still dont work as good as word 2003, so i'll probably have to run vista in a separate system.
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	you don't like openoffice I take it?
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	jasin		to*
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	.debs don't contain source code.
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	they contain binary code
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	jasin		I know what debian packages are
2007-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	but you said they're just source which is not correct
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	jasin		libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb contains source code, its under the compressed file inside data.tar.gz
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	jasin		a lot of debian packages do contain source code
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	if that's the case it's a rare exception to the rule for none source .debs
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	jasin		why do you people have problems with usb? Usb has been suported by the kernel for quit some time now.
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	apt-get this and that is not supposed to get the source
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	apt-get what?
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	anything
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	only apt-get source foo should get the source
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	lol
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	it's true though. unless you specify apt-get source you don't get the source
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	i know what you is talking about now.
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	yeah, thats true
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	jasin		I dont download source code with apt-get I get it with wget
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I see. apt-get source will get you any patches that are installed in ubuntu as well though
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	jasin		if i'm going to install a new kernel I wont even attempt doing it with apt-get i'll download the src from kernel.org with wget directly and compile it myself.
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	but I'd say it's sane in some cases. in other cases not ;)
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	Yeah that's what I do as well
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	that sthe bets way to do it
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	jasin		best*
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I believe the ubuntu kernel contains quite a few patches to the vanilla sources though
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	yes but its only in version 2.6.17.1-10.34
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I know
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	do you need anything in 2.6.19 ?
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	its several versions behind the latest stable release on kernel.org
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	some
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I see. then compiling your own kernel is a good idea. I don't see the point if it's only to make sure you are using the latest, though
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	yeah I agree
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	jasin		.20 is supposedly going to fix some data corruption problem
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I compile my own kernels because I don't want a generic kernel with virtually all options enabled resulting in a huge image
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	smart
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	I must admit I don't see much difference but I don't like the feeling of using a bloated kernel ;)
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	hehe
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	well I guess if you run a loaded server or something it would make sense
2007-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	if i was runing a server i would be be ussing core 2 duo cpus :p
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	if i was runing a server i would not be ussing core 2 duo cpus :p
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	what then?
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	mwe		isn't that supposed to be a mount point?
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	never heard of that but he was talking about having one
2007-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	mwe	jasin	sound weird though
2007-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	that's what I was thinking
2007-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	what you shoping for? hehe
2007-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	jasin	mwe	is a hard core gammer :p
