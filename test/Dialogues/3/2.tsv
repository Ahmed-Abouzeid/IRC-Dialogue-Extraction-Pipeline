2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	AidanL	can you get the computer in question on the internet somehow? (so you can install stuff.)
2007-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	AidanL	is this edgy we're talking about?
2007-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	AidanL	Tann, have you got the ndiswrapper stuff figured out?
