2007-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	elyon		Jordon - see, that's what I'm concerned with.  They stole so much from Wine and now charge for it?
2007-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	elyon		Jordon_U - I'd be willing to pay a bit if it worked perfectly, but that's what I'm trying to figure out.
2007-01-01T08:38:00.000Z	elyon		Can anyone tell me if Cedega is worth the $5/mo for a gamer?
2007-01-01T08:39:00.000Z	Cyclonus	elyon	-  WINE was BSD licensed when it was forked to create Cedega.
2007-01-01T08:39:00.000Z	Cyclonus	elyon	- don't accuse anyone of stealing unless you can prove it
2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	elyon	Cyclonus	- I was told by others that it was stolen.  Forgive me for trusting what I heard in here.
2007-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	elyon		..and by stolen I simply meant used without giving credit.
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	Cyclonus	elyon	- stealing is a juristic defined term
2007-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	elyon		cyclonus - okay, fine.  Let's argue about symantics.. that's not what I came here for.
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	elyon		So... should I assume no one here uses Cedega? :)P
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	elyon	Cyclonus	- it is unethical.  They took all the Wine code, modified it slightly, and began selling it without contributing anything back to Wine itself.  There's a problem there.
2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	Cyclonus	elyon	- nonsense, that's exactly what the BSD license permits
