2007-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	tehArtist		I'm atempting an install on a HP m7160n Media Center, The install starts going great, then it starts looking for disc drives. I then get 'No disk drive was detected. If you know the name of the driver needed by your disk drive, you can select it from the list' and it gives me a list, but I dont know which one to choose. The motherboard is a P5LP-LE made by ASUS. Any ideas?
