2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kitche	superkirbyartist	AIGLX is part of Xorg so you won't see anything in sessions
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	superkirbyartist	kitche	how do I use/load it?
2007-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kitche	superkirbyartist	if you use plain xorg your using AIGLX probably have to see your xorg.0.log to make sure
