2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	shemale		well normally when I let the ubuntu setup resize
2007-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	shemale		automatic resize setup do his work, theres no problem, and it goes to step 6 of 6 , but now im stuck at step 5...
2007-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	shemale		is it possible that my hp tablet has blocked any configuration change to the partitions
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	jasin		I have no idea where you can get 8.24.8, sorry.
2007-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	do the entire erase option.
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	shemale		yah thats what im thinking but the thing is
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	shemale		I dont want to lose the windows partition
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	that wont set up all the separate partitions you need but it will set up the minimal, enough ti get you up and runing.
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	shemale		with the all the shit I wanna keep
2007-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	no, you will erase the entire disk
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	shemale		but what about the windows partition...
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	shemale		its on the disk
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	shemale		so you are saying theres no choice ?
2007-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	either backup or use the gparted linux live cd, http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2007-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	anyways, you shoudll always backup regardless/
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		yah
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	anyways, you should always backup regardless.
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		but I think
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		ill partition my disk
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		in 2 partitions
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		in windows
2007-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	shemale		so that will fix the problem
2007-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	linux should be first and do not install grub to the mbr install it to the boot sec.
2007-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	shemale		well the thing is
2007-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	shemale		to make it clear
2007-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	shemale		my hp tc 4400 tablet is configured on one c: 70 Gbs and one HP SPECIAL BACK UP D :  10 GBS
2007-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	shemale		now I want to install ubuntu with a dual boot
2007-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	shemale		but when I get to the partition setup windows in ubuntu install
2007-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	shemale		when I choose Resize partition #1 and use feed space nothing happen...
2007-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	shemale		when I click on Forward...
2007-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	shemale		maybe someone could give me remote assistance on that one
2007-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	use that live cd I gave you a link too, you can setup the partitions outside of linux with it .. it might make things easier for you.
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	shemale		graphic interface
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	set them up in the free space left over after its resized
2007-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	shemale		yah okey but the thing is I have to do it with the terminal caus theres a fuck with the graphical
2007-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	no, set up the partitions with the live cd I gave you a link to
2007-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	shemale		all right
2007-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	also, you may want to download a now iso for ubuntu, burn a new copy, sounds like yours is messed up.

2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	shemale		I just can restart the comp
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	you need a windows boot disk if you want to fix windows temporarly.
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	shemale		and boot in windows ;)
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	you will have to rebuild the mbr for the time being if you want to boot back into windows
2007-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	shemale		oh yah ?
2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	shemale		caus the installation is not complete
2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	shemale		even if im only in live cd right now...?
2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	yes because you instaleld grub but grub is not confiqured
2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	so it dont know what to boot
2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	shemale		anyway theres no problem
2007-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	shemale		caus I have two comps
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	shemale		my desktop is already installed with dual boot ubuntu and windows
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	shemale		and now all the questions I asked you were for my tablet PC
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	shemale		so even if I run into a problem
2007-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	press esc when grub comes up, if windows is not listed then you will have to rebuild the mbr.
2007-01-01T12:04:00.000Z	shemale		yah but the problem is I cant even go on the Bios...
2007-01-01T12:05:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	linux will nto prevent you from going into the bios, no os will.
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	shemale	jasin	I know that
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	press del or f2 or f12, whatever you is asked to, when you first startup the computer from a cold boot.
2007-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	shemale		caus as of the last time Ive booted
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	unplug the computer, thnen plug it back in and press the power button, thats a cold boot.
2007-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	shemale		lets try with the battery alone
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	if you is in linux you can type poweroff from the comand line, that will shutdown the computer as well
2007-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	shemale		yah but like I said im chatting with you via my desktop comp, but its my tablet pc that is messed up
2007-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	shemale		ohh man cybercod

2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	jasin		always backup yoru data, even if you dont think you need to. If you is not sure what to back up in linux you can backup /  and /home and in windows c:
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	jasin		Thats assuming / is the only partition you have
2007-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	shemale		for laptops or tablets
2007-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	just relax its not that bad.

2007-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	okay, you could try contatcing the Montreal Linux Users Group, maybe they can help you physically in person. There website is: mlug.ca
2007-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	jasin	shemale	not saying you have to its just a suggestion if you get stuck and run out of options for what to do.
