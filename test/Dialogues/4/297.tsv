2007-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	snowflake		The screen just turned pink.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	snowflake		How do I fix this, please?
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	wheeee!  pink!  Now, what did you do?  and what part is pink?  does it have a pink tint, is one program pink, or the whole thing?
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	snowflake		The whole screen is pinkish, please.
2007-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	snowflake		Now, it's not pink but it sometimes turns pinkish.
2007-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	this sounds like a monitor problem...or an IGP problem, but not a Linux problem.
2007-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	do you still HAVE Winxp installed?
2007-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	snowflake	awilcox	No.
2007-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	snowflake		No way to solve this problem, please?
2007-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	one question: do you have different resolutions for each of the accounts?
2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	snowflake		I just take a screen shot of my screen when it is pink. It wasn't pink in the picture.
2007-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	awilcox	snowflake	ah-ha!  it is the monitor!
