2007-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	m12	what did you install it with?
2007-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	m12	make install?
2007-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	m12		yes
2007-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	m12	go back to the source directory and try a make uninstall or a make remove, but not all programs have that feature....
