2007-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	byp		Anyone have any problems with devices no longer being recognized?
2007-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	it sounds like a module issue.. what has changed on your system?
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	rzlist		I'm running 64 bit ubuntu.. it runs great (with the exception of the atheros driver)
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	byp		Syslog showed that it was there, recognnized, but /dev didn't show it
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	did they show up using lsmod?
2007-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	byp		Let me check
2007-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	what device did you lose?
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	any that were plugged in, such as sda and sdb
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	are these SATA or scsi devices?
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	well, _technically_ not SCSI, but I heard from somewhere that sd* would be that
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	these are probably USB storage devices.. are they USB plug-ins?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	Excuse me?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	are these little usb sticks?
2007-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	yes
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	then use: lsmod | grep usb
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	usb_storage should be shown as loaded
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	what output do you want?
2007-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	it's there
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	byp		usb_storage            74304  0
2007-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	that means device is not connected..
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	well, there are two devices connected
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	check dmesg when you unplug and replug the usb stick
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	byp		aight
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	byp		[17192568.604000]  usb 4-8: USB disconnect, address 16
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	byp		disconnect...
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	nothing on connect
2007-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	try: modprobe usb_storage
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	nothing returned
2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	use: depmod -a, then modprobe usb_storage
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	done, but no results still

2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	what brand of USB storage is it?
2007-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	any USB device I plug in, iPod, sandisk cruzer, etc.
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	all I did was run shred on my flash drive, then fdisked it, and then mkdosfs
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	I had missing superblock errors, then everything went downhill
2007-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	udev too
2007-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	let me check and I'll be back
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	Have you tried rebooting the box to see if it made a difference?
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	that usually fixes the problem
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	found this in syslog
2007-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	byp		Dec 31 17:17:38 localhost kernel: [17188908.920000]  usb-storage: device scan complete

2007-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	well.. if the linux kernel does not find a valid media then it will ignore it.. and this is probably what happend.
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	however, when this happenedDec 31 17:47:32 localhost kernel: [17190703.156000]  sd 13:0:0:0: Attached scsi removable disk sda
2007-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	it was still  not working
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	nothing in /dev
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	however, using mknod sda1 b 8 1, then mounting, it worked
2007-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	Ubuntu usually creates a mounting entry under /media.. did it create one?
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	no
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	a reboot should take care of all this - I just want to know what the problem is so I can avoid it in the future
2007-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	byp	rzlist	thanks
2007-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	rzlist	byp	good luck..
