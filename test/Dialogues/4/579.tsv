2007-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	maddash		does anyone here use popularity-contest?
2007-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	i do, well, i have it installed and it does it's thing, can't say i use it
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	god your name is so tedious to the fingers. pop-contest works in the background?
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	yea, as a cronjob or something, everyday when APT looks for updates and so
2007-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	I could say your name is tedious too -- mad<TAB> :d
2007-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	yea, popcon is mostly unobtrusive
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	my program sucks. no autocomplete. for me, popcon is unobtrusive as the sky until I open synaptic.
2007-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	how does it interfere? it shouldn't
2007-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	I think I have geek ocd or something. I can't stand having programs I can't use. everytime I see it in synaptic, my fingers act on their own accord and purge it from the disk
2007-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	then, my conscience kicks in and i reinstall it
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	popcon is purely optional, you dont really need it although the ubuntu-dev teams could do with stats polled from your setup
2007-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	I don't think they'd get much from my bare-bones install. haha.
2007-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	anyway, I think I'll *rationally* get rid of it for once and for all. good riddance.
2007-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	neither do they with mine, but i have it anyway, i believe no matter how small your contribution is, it's a contribution nonetheless (to the bigger picture anyway)
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	what? you're my jiminy cricket conscience now?
2007-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	j/k. sudo aptitude install popularity-contest, I guess
2007-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	you could say -- was just justifying why i kepy popcon on my barebones install :)
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	what setup do you have? server install? wm? panel? browser? x.org? xfree86?
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	well, yea, if you can afford 188 bytes of install space and 1 minute of cronjob time everyday, why not? install it? :)
2007-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	haha, 'cept w/my poorman's system, it's about 4 min of cron time
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	mine's a xorg/xdm/fluxbox
2007-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	poorer than my 1ghz/256MB box?
2007-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	finally. a non-xfce purist. what's your panel? or does flux come w/one already? how do you get your desktop icons? xdm= login screen?
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	I don't use a panel, fluxbox has a slit which you can configure -- I dont use desktop icons, why have them anyway if you are never going to use them -- and yea xdg is the lighter counterpart to gdm
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	un_operateur		s/xdg/xdm/
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	my development sys: 192 ram/501 mhz. haha.
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	xdg? or xdm? I'm confused...
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	that does quite well unless you play the latest version of quake :)
2007-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	my next post s///ed that mistake :)
2007-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	xdm 'twas
2007-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	haha thanks for the info. my new setup's going to run faster than xp, I think.
2007-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	what do you currently use?
2007-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	right now? xp. I'm trying to build a new setup on my thinkpad (which is considerably faster than my dev machine, but gnome bogs it down)...so far, I've got a server setup, x-windows-system-core, openbox/obconf, idesk, and fbpanel. and firefox, but I'm going to purge it in favor of dillo.
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	maddash		MIKE_: ok, so select /dev/hda2 and delete the partition.
2007-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	well, that sounds good enough -- kinda similar to mine but I have to use gnome tho (i wish i didnt have to) at times mainly due to Evolution and a few others
2007-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	why not just kick out gnome and do openbox + evol?
2007-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	well, mainly because i can't be asked to do a non-gnome thingy plus it's only evol that's a pain (non-issue really)
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	so you have 2 sep sessions? for gnome and flux?
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	I got enough memory to spare that's doing nothing, I can afford to let Evolution be greedy
2007-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	hah. nice.
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	no no, just one session -- but I run the gnome-settings-daemon in the background, so some apps have a gnome-ish feel to them
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	maddash	un_operateur	why not just get a gnome theme for flux?
2007-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	because my theme rocks better :)
2007-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	maddash		who the heck is nalioth, anyway?
2007-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	un_operateur	maddash	an op
