2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	thanks:)
2007-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	but that won't work for ftp right?
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	HawkeV	zOap	you didn't say it was for ftp, heh
2007-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	no, I thought it would be the same.. but I was arrogantly wrong:D sorry..
2007-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	HawkeV	zOap	it may not be 'frozen'
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV		then delete every file/folder one by one
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	well, I've tried on many servers, the same result...
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	HawkeV		have you tried on a folder with one file in it?
2007-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	yes, works fine
2007-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	well in this particular example I'm trying to delete 223 folders and about 800 files...
2007-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	HawkeV	zOap	ask your admin to rm -rf the dir =P
2007-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	zOap	HawkeV	yeah, I may have to.. thanks for the help btw:)
