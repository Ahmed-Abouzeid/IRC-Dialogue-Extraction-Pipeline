2007-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	jasin		i'm a student so I have tohave a working word processer and abi-word seems to be the best in linux but it still dont work as good as word 2003, so i'll probably have to run vista in a separate system.
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput	jasin	that's a little extreme ;)
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	jasin	ootput	runing word 2003 in wine is messy
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput	jasin	with vista, you'll end up getting much more than you'd bargained for ;)
2007-01-01T10:17:00.000Z	ootput	jasin	yes it is
2007-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	jasin	ootput	I wouldn;t pay for it anyways, so its no big deal.
