2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	fritsch		hi! is there a way to just build the generic kernel from the 2.6.20 feisty kernel
2007-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	fritsch		it lasted over 5 hours to build me the whole stuff from this package
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	don't bother unless you absolutely need to
2007-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	there must be an option, an argument i think?
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	nope
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	Why are you building a custom kernel?  Do you really need to?
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	yes i do
2007-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i build kernels now over five years, so this is not the problem, i just wanted to stick to the ubuntu packages
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	what is the need that the stock kernel does not address for you?
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	some patches, for exampe acpi ones
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	and the ubuntu version is more integrated
2007-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i do not have to google hours to search important patches and apply them myself
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	if you want packages, be sure to install kernel-package and use make-kpkg
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	some even get rejected, i have to fix them to apply mysel
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	okay ;-) sorry, i do not think you can really help me
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	tritium	fritsch	you haven't asked anything
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	as i said above, i build debian kernel images for years now
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i did
2007-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i get the linux-image source from the feisty kernel
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	agfter that i ran a dpkg-buildpackage to compile it on edgy
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	problem is: bigiron, 386, etc. kernels are build this needs 5 hours
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i just want to compile the generic version
2007-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	tritium		You can't, as I said, from the linux-source packages
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	i think i can, i just look into debian/rules
2007-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	but i thought somebody has it handy for me already
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	just found it
2007-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	fritsch	tritium	in debian/control i just comment out the packages i do not need
