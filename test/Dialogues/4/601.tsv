2007-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	unimatrix9		maybe there is an option in bios that will help, but i am not sure about that ( vaio )
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	unimatrix9		reading the viao bios pdf right now to see
2007-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	matsyes	unimatrix9	i dont follow exactly
2007-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	matsyes		when i do recovery boot ..then i have no probs it comes to the command prompt
2007-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	unimatrix9	matsyes	there are two things you could try ( later , if no one gives you an better advice ) first boot from the ubuntu install cdrom, its also an live cd, see if it hangs too on battery mode , second boot the vaio, press F2 you go into your bios, be carefull what you do here, go to Boot, and make sure the boot from usb is not as first boot device...
2007-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	matsyes		unimatrix9,Jowi:the wierdest thing happened i kept booting it a couple of times thru ac and now it just booted thru battery i have no idea whats going on but its working tho i thing i'll yet give it some time to see if this is a permanent change for the better :) or maybe go for a complete reinstall anyway
2007-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	unimatrix9		thats odd indeed
2007-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	unimatrix9		keep an eye on that battery....
2007-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	matsyes	unimatrix9	tell me about it but i'm happy its working for now tho i'll try to figure out whats going on
2007-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	matsyes		unimatrix9:i'll be keeping an eye on it :)
