2007-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	seamus_ie		hey all, I have a new laptop with a amd turion64 uP, I also have a very slow internet connection so what i'm wondering is if there is much difference between the standard ubuntu cd and the amd 64bit cd apart from the kernel, which I can download a lot easier than the whole cd
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	i think u should choose the amd64 cd
2007-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	seamus_ie	chable	Why?
2007-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	because its suites your cpu
2007-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	seamus_ie	chable	yes I know but I don't want to spend 24 hours downloading the cd when I have the 32 bit version if the only big difference is the kernel
2007-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	sorry then
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	seamus_ie		so Dunca1 are you now running the 32 bit kernel?
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	chable	seamus_ie	just install the normal ubuntu
