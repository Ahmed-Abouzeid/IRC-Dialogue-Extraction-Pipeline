2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	minerale		when I'm doing a ./configure on a program that requires the perl libraries, how would one provide the path to the perl libraries?
2007-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	minerale	I think you can modify the PERL5LIB environmental variable
2007-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	minerale	do you want to specify new paths to a perl program -- or determine what directories the perl libs exist in?
2007-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	minerale	I think this command is what you need -  perl -le 'print for @INC'
