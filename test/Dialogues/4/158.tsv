2007-01-01T01:57:00.000Z	ShayGuy		I'm using my laptop, on a home wireless network, with a D-Link router.
2007-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	phr34ck	ShayGuy	what was the problem? why you couldn't connect ?
2007-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	ShayGuy		Not sure. Think I need to fiddle with the configurations (it /is/ Linux) but I'd like to know what I'm doing.
2007-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	ShayGuy		I barely even understand the problem.
