2007-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	jasin	ripperda	you have to put it in your network settings and also kwifi if you are ussing kde or kubuntu.
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	jasin	ripperda	you have to set it for eth1 if thats your wifi, too.
2007-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	ripperda	jasin	unfortunately, not using kde/kubuntu. what do you mean by network settings? my wifi device is eth0
