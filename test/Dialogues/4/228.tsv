2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	rye78		I got a small stupid question for you ubuntu users, I'd first liek to say I know my way around linux (recompiling linux, changing permissions, basic stuff like that), and before i moved to ubuntu...is ubuntu...well..'respectable'?, I dont want to be using something that is like...fisher price.  I hope someone knows what I mean so they can elaborate =/
