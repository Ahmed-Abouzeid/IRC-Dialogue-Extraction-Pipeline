2007-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	Core		Core 2 Duo E6300, mobo Intel DD946GZis, HD SATA2 160GB, DDR2 533MHz 1GB Kingstom
2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	Core		people how do I use IRC???
2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	Core		it's so confusing
2007-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	just for reference heres your mobo specs http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/D946GZIS/index.htm
2007-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	Core		does someone have had trouble with SATA2 or DDR2 or C2D with Ubuntu????????????????
2007-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	lots of people do.  you're doing fine on IRC by the way, just talk like you are now ,that's all irc is anyway ;)
2007-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	Core		--- xtknight --- : I've seen the specs
2007-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	Core		--- xtknight --- : but don't know what to do
2007-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Core		--- Maheannu --- : what's your Ubuntu's version?
2007-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Core		--- Maheannu --- : mine is 6.06
2007-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Core		--- Maheannu --- : i can't get 6.10 now to test
2007-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	does your board have a jmicron controller?
2007-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	Core		I buyed my PC two days ago
2007-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	opensuse 10.2 does install on C2D
2007-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Core		I have debian
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	debian has some kernels that work with core 2 duo http://kmuto.jp/debian/d-i/
2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	rather someone has modified them to work
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	dapper and edgy do not work properly with jmicron, u must use feisty or fedora core 6 or opensuse 10.2 or find an alternate way of booting dapper since edgy doesnt work with ich8 either
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	so edgy doesn't works in no way but dapper that is older do?
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	Core		--- All People ---: or find an alternative customized kernel for 6.06 and 6.10
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	yes
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	or boot 6.06 using alternate method
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	Core		--- All People ---: and to do that I have to install 6.06 and update its kernel
2007-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	yes
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Core		--- All People ---: but to do it I ghave to disable USB on BIOS
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	in some cases.  i did not have to.
2007-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	hello
2007-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	hello, you do remember me!
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	another suggestion?
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	yeah i do :P  you'll have to try a newer distro with the 2.6.18 kernel.  dapper or edgy will not work
2007-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	if i could at least install something and then get the kernel
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	what's the size of your kernels?
2007-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i'm on a dialed conn
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	the funny thin is:
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	my Kurumim DO works
2007-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	it just don't recognize SATA :(
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and a very old version
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	it detected both cores
2007-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	uhh, my 2.6.19 kernel ( here http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=326343 ) is roughly 25 megs total
2007-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	that should be what 2 hours on dialup?  But it may be worth it...but u still can not boot dapper or edgy by the way
2007-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	25MB at 5KB/s...
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	yeah
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	1,5 h
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i'm thinkig a way to install this kernel from Kurumim
2007-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	but that kernel is only useful if you already have linux installed
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	yeah
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	...
2007-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	another way is to update Kurumim on the RAM!
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	ahh ok, hope it works
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	so that it recognizes SATA
2007-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	sorry
2007-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	Core		---- Does someone have had trouble with 6.06LTS + SATA/Core2Duo?
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	plenty of people have the problem, not just you
2007-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	so there's nothing more I can do here beyound you told me?
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	you will have to install fedora core 6 or opensuse 10.2, no current Ubuntu has support for your board, sorry
2007-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	it is either that or installing ubuntu from a USB CDROM or ethernet
2007-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i am running Edgy on a core 2 duo but i had to go through lots of trouble
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	fedora core 6 and Suse 10.2 are paid?
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	no they are free, sues is called opensuse 10.2 (the free one is)
2007-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	a guy on my work loves Suse
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	the next version of Ubuntu should support core 2 duo without issues
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	when it will be released?
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i just can't wait
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	you could also download Debian with a modified kernel, these worked awesome for me.  debian is much like ubuntu: http://kmuto.jp/debian/d-i/
2007-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	my Kurumim works, but is old!
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and runs only by CD
2007-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	try the debian images i linked above
2007-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	ok
2007-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	120 MB!
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and i have no CD to burn!
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	well, I think i will not be able to use my power machine today
2007-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i guess not, you will need a cd for that debian
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	xtknight		!dri
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	and about our trouble, did not you have written a how-to?
2007-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i have only written what i linked to you .. i may write more on the core 2 duo issue.  im still debugging jmicron problems
2007-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	ok
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	if would exist a way to run the iso as it was a cd...
2007-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	you can mount an iso if that's what you mean but i'm not sure how that would help
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	humm...
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	i mount it
2007-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	then run the installer
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	without needing a CD
2007-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i'm not familiar with that method but it may be possible
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	thank you very much for the help!
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	no problem, i hope it works out
2007-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	just one thing? the new release will be when?
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	i am not sure, i think ubuntu releases every 6 months, so maybe in 4 months from now?
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	look at the roadmap: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyReleaseSchedule
2007-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Core	xtknight	6.06 is from June, so the next would be December...
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	Core		People, so 6.10 is not LTS
2007-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Core	correct
