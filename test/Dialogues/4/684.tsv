2007-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	you need to enable all repositories
2007-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	i need to be connected to the internet to do this
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	yeah..do u not have net now?
2007-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	youll have to wait til u get net til u can install mp3 support i think
2007-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	no, Im on my windows machine and im trying to configure my stuff on mylaptop becasue Im on dialup
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	confused...so is downloading a couple debs feasible for you at the moment?
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	you can download debs at packages.ubuntu.com and install them later
2007-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	yeah I bought aportable harddrive the other day
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	but everytime i try to install something it tries to go to the internet to find stuff
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	what other installation media do u have
2007-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	?\
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	other than internet?  how else would it install things?
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	do u have an ubuntu cd, or dvd?
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	I have the image burned on a cd
2007-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	im afraid xmms isnt on the cd by default so it must go to the internet
2007-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	whats the ubuntu site to download the dap files?
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	nn531		deb imean
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	packages.ubuntu.com , select Dapper and search for a package
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	or whatever distro ur using
2007-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	nn531		i see
2007-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	i thought a dap package meant u wanted one for dapper ;)
2007-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	download xmms and xmms-mad?
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	yes, u may also have to download dependencies for those if needed, but it should only amount to about 5 packages total at most just for xmms and xmms-mad...i think
2007-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	just try xmms and xmms-mad, then once u install them on the target pc it will ask for dependencies, then transfer those over as needed
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	I dont understand why rhythmbox wont work, why would they even put it on there to begin with?
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	it's illegal to have mp3 support in by default
2007-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	due to copyright laws i think, or something like that, but no linux distro can include it
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	nn531	xtknight	i see, just another microsoft thing huh?
2007-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	xtknight	nn531	i guess....i think microsoft pays fraunhofer iis for permission to use mp3
