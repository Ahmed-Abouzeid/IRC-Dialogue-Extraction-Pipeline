2007-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		Do man mount in a terminal to know... :-)
2007-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	please explain this to me sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000, i want a explanation for -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000 ONLY, and the man page is too cryptic :)
2007-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		tnx jame1, you beat me to it... :-)
2007-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1: will this work? sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows vfat?
2007-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		see http://www.tech-faq.com/umask.shtml for explanation about umask
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1:  So sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows -t vfat
2007-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		UMASK is a Unix environment variable which automatically sets file permissions on newly created files.
2007-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		hold on to the defaults, they just work fine in most cases
2007-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		cybercod; select boot in defaults in your bios to restore things ?
2007-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	jame1 cybercod could you please help me with the above question?
2007-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		sorry kenthomson, I'm using strictly kde here... no gnome....
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	any special reason for your inclination towards KDE?
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	i used KDE and found it to be too cluttered, and favouring the ZEN mentality i shifted to GNOME
2007-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	yes, I just like KDE better, but that's only a matter of taste, isn't it...
2007-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	and there is some reason for everyone's taste, so my question is what in KDE suits your taste?:)
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	there doesn't seem to be any package availeble that's providing disks-admin in ubuntu ?
2007-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	yes
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	the command seems to be gone, it was there before edgy...
2007-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	kenthomson	thelinuxguy	doesn't work in 6.10
2007-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	like I said, it used to work in Dapper !
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	thelinuxguy	kenthomson	I've found it: install with sudo apt-get install pysdm
2007-01-01T01:04:00.000Z	thelinuxguy		then you will find it under system...Administration.....Storage Device Manager
