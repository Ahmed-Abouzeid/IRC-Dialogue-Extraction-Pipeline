2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		do you have to install network manager or where is it?
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	tritium	VerdRousseau	no, you don't have to, but if you want to, you certainly can
2007-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		I mean is it already installed?
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	VerdRousseau		so you reccomend network manager over gtkwifi?
