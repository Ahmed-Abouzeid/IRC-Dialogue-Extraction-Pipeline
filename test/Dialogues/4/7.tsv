2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	Marelo		damn!! how difficult could be to run unreal tournament in linux!
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	not very :)
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	Marelo		sometimes i think just to give up and go back do windows
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	Marelo		hehehehehe
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	just get the shell script, execute it and you are done
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	ooooooooooooooo no! i've been trought a lot more than that
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	what have you been doing wrong then? ;)
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	i wish i knew. but there's the thing... i'm supposed to DON'T NEED to do anything besides installing the game. see what i mean?
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	you dont. just copy the shell script from the cd, set the x bit, execute it, follow the install through and launch the game
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	i installed the game alright. but it's freezing! like what, 8 fps!
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	then you need graphics drivers
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	i tried
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	but...?
2007-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	guess? but no changes!
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	then you probably didnt do it right
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	nvidia or ati?
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	intel
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	then i wouldnt expect any more than you are getting...
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	why?
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	the cards are slow to begin with :)
2007-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	but the game isn't heavy
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	Marelo		i915GM/GMS
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	but its not configured to use it
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	Marelo	nolimitsoya	then how can i configure to use it?
2007-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Marelo	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg <- select the right driver to begin with
