2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	do it with gparted
2007-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	then when i reboot to windows,will it recognize the new partition?
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	get the gparted linux livecd, download the iso and burn it to a cd, boot with that and set up your partitions from there.
2007-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	after their set up with that restart the system and boot into the ubuntu installer with your ubuntu cd
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	i have gparted installed, why should i use live cd? is there any other differeneces?
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	because you can setup the partitions outside of the ubuntu install cd
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	i ve running ubntu :D
2007-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	if you are runing ubuntu why do you need to partition?
2007-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	jasin	i ve 3 parttion windows,data,ubuntu, i want to split data into data and mac,because i will install mac on it
2007-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	jasin	sc4ttrbrain	I never set up my partitions within linux, I like control over how their set up, I like to low level format, check for errors, setup separate partitions not outside of linux in case i run into error,etc.., but thats me.
