2007-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	shemale		very appreciated
2007-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	cybercod	shemale	you could also use partition magic to resize first from windoze and click install to largest free space
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	cybercod		you can access windows partition from live disk
2007-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	cybercod		you just have to mount it... in Disks
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		its read only, but you may be able to burn the ISO.... i dunno if live disk has burner ready to go
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		may also depend on how much ram you have for the ramdrive
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		Part Magic is a little more polished
2007-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	cybercod		but each has their limitations
2007-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	shemale		I have 1.5 Gbs ;)
2007-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	cybercod		you may have to use synaptic to install burning into live disk session
2007-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	cybercod	shemale	check IM
2007-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	cybercod	shemale	still there?

2007-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	cybercod		you wanna know how to mount them manually for the live session?
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	cybercod		they'll be mounted auto after the install
2007-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	cybercod		its not hard... you don't need a script
2007-01-01T11:47:00.000Z	cybercod		you need to edit fstab then
2007-01-01T11:47:00.000Z	cybercod		koyo... i'm familiar with that... but wait a moment
