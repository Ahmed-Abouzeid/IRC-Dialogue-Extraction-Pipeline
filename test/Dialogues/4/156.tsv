2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	phr34ck		What's happening under the hood ?
2007-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	under the hood it's calling dpkg
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	phr34ck		what's that?
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	under THAT hood it's decompressing the .deb file and installing it to the paths that it's told to, kind of like a ZIP file on Windows with paths, but .deb instead
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	phr34ck		I see.
2007-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	run    man dpkg   from the Konsole
2007-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	FYI it's 1024x768, and you're probably wanting 1280x768

2007-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	phr34ck		what does Fakeroot do? I saw it twice today.
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	fakeroot makes dpkg THINK that it is running as root/superuser when it really isn't -- for more info, man fakeroot :D
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		is that a command ?
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	yeah but you would have to install fakeroot first
2007-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	phr34ck		it's not there .

2007-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	phr34ck		can I transform .tar.gz files into .deb files ?
2007-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	awilcox	phr34ck	no, but you can run tar -xzf filename.tar.gz and it will make a directory, then it will probably have something like ./configure, then make, then make install
