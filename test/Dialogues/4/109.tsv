2007-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	you are typing the wrong password
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i created the user with that password
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		i used openssh to do it
2007-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	caps-lock?
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	numlock?
2007-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	make sure that the capslock is in the same state as when you set the password
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	the password is case sensitive
2007-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	and if the num-lock is in a different state, that can also make the typing come out differently than you expect
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	try going to the original machine and signing in with the username/password you are trying to use with ssh
2007-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i tryied it with 2 users i created but dont accept the password when i test ssh it says permission denied and after 3 times it says Permission denied (publickey,password).
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that's what happens for me when i type the pw wrong.  or maybe the username is wrong?
2007-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	other than that i wouldn't know what could cause that behavior
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	do you have physical access to the machine you are trying to ssh to?
2007-01-01T02:57:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	also, paste the line you are using to try to use to ssh
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	paste it here, that is
2007-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i opened it in my own machine and im only testing it
2007-01-01T02:59:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	do you mean you are trying to ssh from one machine to itself?
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	yes
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that's not a normal use of ssh, i'll try it here and see what happens
2007-01-01T03:00:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	ok
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	it works here
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	i do gracioso@darkthrone:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		* Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server...                               [ ok ] 
2007-01-01T03:02:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	using the same username and password.  the fact that it gets to the part where it asks for a password means that it's connecting
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	you shouldn't have to do that
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		i installed
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that will take care of starting the server for you.  did you install it that way?
2007-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	and you are connecting, the server is running, otherwise it wouldn't even get to the point of asking for a pw
2007-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		yeah i installed openssh-server then i do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start then i try to test it with my own user doing ssh user@ip then when it asks for password it say permission denied and after 3 times it says Permission denied (publickey,password). and i dont know why
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	yeah i installed openssh-server then i do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start then i try to test it with my own user doing ssh user@ip then when it asks for password it say permission denied and after 3 times it says Permission denied (publickey,password). and i dont know why
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	you shouldn't have to do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2007-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		why?
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	the apt-get install takes care of that.  but that's a side issue, it's not affecting the current problem
2007-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	paste the entire thing at http://rafb.net/paste
2007-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	then paste the resulting url here
2007-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	http://rafb.net/p/XtGFjf68.html
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	i notice you are sshing specifying the name karla, but the command prompt shows your name as gracioso
2007-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	try ssh gracioso@189...
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	and use the password for that user
2007-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	also, don't do sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start any more
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO		http://rafb.net/p/1PAW9g95.html
2007-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	http://rafb.net/p/1PAW9g95.html
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	that is exactly the behavior i get when i type the password incorrectly.  it stops accepting passwords after 3 tries to keep people from trying billions until they get the right one
2007-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	gRaCiOsO	ozzloy	im typing the correct password im just using that user
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	at the shell type passwd
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	ozzloy		it will ask for your current password
2007-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	ozzloy	gRaCiOsO	^
