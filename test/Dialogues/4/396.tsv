2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	timo901		chable:yess i have a 64 bit not only did i not see a difference ,benchmarks show no improvement but a Delcine
2007-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	you need 64bit applications to benefit
2007-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	timo901		nolimitsoya:i know but ubuntu 64 has a browser with 64 bit support and even that is is not impressive
2007-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	perhaps youve hit another bottleneck than you rprocessor :)
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	i have a theory that 64 was for security
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	mostly DRM
2007-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	thats not true :)
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	we will have to agree to disagree
2007-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	read up please. drm has nothing to do with it
2007-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	timo901	nolimitsoya	I mean surely you cant say there is a vast improvement over 32 bit
2007-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	yes i can. as i said, read up
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	timo901		must be very fast
2007-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	its not that simple...
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	timo901		nolimitsoya:if we want improvement we going o have to get new better motherboards and software to make the best out of these 256 bit CPU
2007-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	timo901	no, its not that simple either. please read up and understand what the bit width is a ll about. wikipedia is a good start
