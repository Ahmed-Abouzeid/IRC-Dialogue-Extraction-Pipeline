2016-08-08T00:26:00.000Z	dcook	Teenage dcook would not have been fond of tying a tie during high school
2016-08-08T00:26:00.000Z	dcook	Although I think I liked the idea of a uniform just so that I didn't have to pick out clothes to wear when I did drag myself into the classroom..
2016-08-08T00:26:00.000Z	* dcook	probably would've preferred something from a sci fi movie rather than a suit and tie though
2016-08-08T00:32:00.000Z	jcamins	dcook: you would've been brilliant young Wesley Crusher?
2016-08-08T00:37:00.000Z	dcook	It's been a long time since I watched TNG, but I think I disliked Wesley Crusher :p
2016-08-08T00:38:00.000Z	dcook	I think I was pro-borg and yet anti-conformity
2016-08-08T00:38:00.000Z	dcook	Quite the paradox
2016-08-08T00:38:00.000Z	dcook	Maybe I just liked the borg aesthetic and order :p
2016-08-08T00:39:00.000Z	jcamins	Everyone disliked brilliant young Wesley Crusher.
2016-08-08T00:40:00.000Z	dcook	hehe
2016-08-08T00:40:00.000Z	dcook	I think I disliked how chipper he seemed
2016-08-08T00:40:00.000Z	dcook	I was a bit more of a moody teenager
2016-08-08T00:40:00.000Z	dcook	Wesley Crusher seemed eager to please, and that was the opposite of what I wanted to do
2016-08-08T01:46:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	dunno crusher gave his mum some serious trouble occasionally :P
2016-08-08T01:46:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	we have gone full nerd.

2016-08-08T02:09:00.000Z	dcook	Nah, I think this is still low level nerd
2016-08-08T02:09:00.000Z	dcook	If we were arguing specific details from particular episodes... that would be full nerd
2016-08-08T02:10:00.000Z	dcook	Or debating Captain Kirk vs Captain Picard
2016-08-08T02:10:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	as if there is a debate to be had there.
2016-08-08T02:10:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	because we all know picard is better. :P
2016-08-08T02:10:00.000Z	dcook	hehe

2016-08-08T02:11:00.000Z	dcook	And now organizing old photos on my desktop via an app on my phone as I hold a sleeping baby all evening

2016-08-08T04:51:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	yeah I was just thinking that
2016-08-08T04:51:00.000Z	dcook	"Some of the most significant recent developments in Canadian currency were the withdrawal of the $1, $2, and $1,000 notes in 1987, 1996, and 2000 respectively. The $1 and $2 denominations have been replaced with coins, colloquially referred to as the "loonie" and "toonie" respectively. In 2000, the $1,000 note was removed at the request of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as it was reported that they were largely
2016-08-08T04:51:00.000Z	dcook	being used for money laundering and organized crime."
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	dcook	Fun fact ^
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	hehe loonie and toonie
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	dcook	Back at my parents' house, I actually still have a few old Canadian $1 bills
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	i loooove $1 and $2 coins
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	dcook	One of my favourite things about Australia? They call them "one dollar coin" and "two dollar coin"
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	dcook	Loonie and toonie...
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	though oz's ones are so bewildering
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	dcook	wizzycrayfish: They're the royals of coins!
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	dcook	Yeah?
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	why are the 2's smaller than the 1s?
2016-08-08T04:52:00.000Z	* magnuse	is up at the regular time, but noone else is up yet, so i might as well try and work a little
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	MAKES NO SENSE
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	Because good things come in small packages?
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	pft
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	hehe
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	I like that they're smaller
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	nz does it properly.
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	I can have a pocketful of $2 coins and have it add up without weighing me down
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	Yeah?
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	How big is your 50 cent piece?
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	magnuse	our coins have all the wrong sizes
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	appropriately sized in order :P
2016-08-08T04:53:00.000Z	dcook	magnuse: How long have you been awake?
2016-08-08T04:54:00.000Z	magnuse	23 minutes

2016-08-08T04:54:00.000Z	dcook	magnuse: Ok, that doesn't seem so bad. You have kids so I'll allow it
2016-08-08T04:54:00.000Z	* dcook	went to bed at 3am and woke up at 8am?

2016-08-08T04:54:00.000Z	* magnuse	needs 8 hours

2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	I see a lot of wealthy people pushing around prams
2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	wizzycrayfish: You know, that's the first thing you ever wrote to me on IRC :p
2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	what?
2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	Back in 2012

2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	Well, worded slightly differently
2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	haha yep

2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	that can't be tru
2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	I think I said something rather stupid, and you gave me a withering one
2016-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	dcook	hehe
2016-08-08T04:57:00.000Z	dcook	Me and jcamins were having a bit of a heated back and forth
2016-08-08T04:57:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	I'm not sure I've said that to anyone else!
2016-08-08T04:57:00.000Z	dcook	I could probably find it in the archives..
2016-08-08T04:57:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	lol maybe
2016-08-08T04:57:00.000Z	dcook	Funny how time changes things
2016-08-08T04:58:00.000Z	dcook	#koha has been so good for me
2016-08-08T04:58:00.000Z	dcook	H'okay... 2013 ... probably march..
2016-08-08T04:58:00.000Z	dcook	2012 i mean
2016-08-08T04:59:00.000Z	dcook	Hmm maybe it wasn't withering..
2016-08-08T05:00:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	http://irc.koha-community.org/[…]3-02-05#i_1176687
2016-08-08T05:00:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	loool
2016-08-08T05:00:00.000Z	dcook	lol
2016-08-08T05:01:00.000Z	dcook	I wonder why that was 2013...
2016-08-08T05:01:00.000Z	dcook	So it couldn't have been one of the first things you ever said to me
2016-08-08T05:01:00.000Z	wizzycrayfish	clearly it was memorable :P
2016-08-08T05:01:00.000Z	dcook	lol
2016-08-08T05:01:00.000Z	dcook	Just a little bit!
2016-08-08T05:02:00.000Z	dcook	It's weird...I'm not finding my earlier stuff
2016-08-08T05:02:00.000Z	dcook	Google seems to think this is my earliest mention http://irc.koha-community.org/koha/2012-03-16
2016-08-08T05:03:00.000Z	dcook	But surely I was on IRC before I sent in that patch..
2016-08-08T05:04:00.000Z	magnuse	the irc log search has 2012-06-27 as the first date
2016-08-08T05:04:00.000Z	magnuse	http://irc.koha-community.org/[…]oha;q=;offset=750
2016-08-08T05:04:00.000Z	dcook	Yeah I was just about to post that
2016-08-08T05:04:00.000Z	dcook	Lost my connection for a sec though :p
2016-08-08T05:04:00.000Z	dcook	Bizarre
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	magnuse	i disconnected you so i could say it first

2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	And after I permitted you to get up at that time...
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	Maybe?
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	wahanui	Maybe is a momentaneous error
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	I would doubt it... but maybe
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	* dcook	ponders
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	That must be it
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	Mmmm
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	Originally... I did use a web client
2016-08-08T05:05:00.000Z	dcook	So maybe I did use whatever nickname was autogenerated
2016-08-08T05:06:00.000Z	dcook	As I didn't think I was really going to be sticking around :p
2016-08-08T05:06:00.000Z	magnuse	"05:50 dcook I installed 3.8.0 back in May" :-)
2016-08-08T05:06:00.000Z	dcook	This is really shaking my memory confidence... haha
2016-08-08T05:06:00.000Z	dcook	I started in January that year..
2016-08-08T05:06:00.000Z	dcook	But I suppose I didn't start really working on Koha until later
2016-08-08T05:07:00.000Z	dcook	"05:52caitcustomizations are always trouble"
2016-08-08T05:07:00.000Z	dcook	^
2016-08-08T05:07:00.000Z	dcook	That's the thing I remember most... haha
2016-08-08T05:08:00.000Z	magnuse	and your whole job was dealing with customizations?
2016-08-08T05:08:00.000Z	dcook	At that stage for sure
2016-08-08T05:08:00.000Z	dcook	We were on 3.2 and so behind the times
2016-08-08T05:08:00.000Z	dcook	Of course, we still have way too many local customizations...
2016-08-08T05:09:00.000Z	dcook	And now I'm busy with non-Koha work so I can't upstream stuff..
2016-08-08T05:09:00.000Z	* dcook	shouldn't even be here right now

2016-08-08T05:09:00.000Z	dcook	I must have come in with a different nick earlier... as I don't see jcamins getting short with me :p
2016-08-08T05:10:00.000Z	dcook	Ugh, I need to stop reading this. I can never stand records of me fromt he past :p
2016-08-08T05:10:00.000Z	dcook	wizzycrayfish: But yes. Withering look... stayed in my memory :p

2016-08-08T07:53:00.000Z	cait	glad it worked for you too - Christopher got me a bit worried last night, but it worked really well for me
2016-08-08T07:54:00.000Z	cait	mveron: did you notice that you have to enter amounts with a comma now when adding a fine/fee manually?
2016-08-08T07:54:00.000Z	cait	it seems to be related to the new entry thing - and it's only in that one place
2016-08-08T07:54:00.000Z	cait	have to go, bbl

2016-08-08T09:14:00.000Z	morgane	hi, I try to reset my database, so I recreate it then when I do a updatedatabase.pl I have the following error : DBIx::Class::Row::get_column(): No such column 'serialseq_x' on Koha::Schema::Result::Serial at installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl line 11518. I don't know what to do, any idea ?
2016-08-08T09:21:00.000Z	eythian	how did you reset it?
2016-08-08T09:23:00.000Z	morgane	eythian: I droped and created it then I put a demo dump. and I just solved my problem :) thanks
2016-08-08T09:24:00.000Z	eythian	cool :) I'd have guessed that the demo was from a different version and the update didn't kick in for some reason.
2016-08-08T09:30:00.000Z	morgane	yes the demo was from an older version, but I run several times the updatedatabase.pl and now it seems to work.
