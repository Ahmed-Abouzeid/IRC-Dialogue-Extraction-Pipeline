2010-01-20T03:06:00.000Z	chris	(ie we should rebase before sending patches)

2010-01-20T13:24:00.000Z	* jwagner	makes an indistinct mumble resembling "good morning"
2010-01-20T13:29:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	good morning
2010-01-20T13:41:00.000Z	oceb	morning
2010-01-20T13:44:00.000Z	owen	Hi oceb
2010-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	oceb	hi owen
2010-01-20T13:51:00.000Z	oceb	do you know why advanced search with Date of publication, distribution (260c) isn't workin on opac?
2010-01-20T13:51:00.000Z	owen	oceb: Does it return no results, or incorrect results?
2010-01-20T13:51:00.000Z	oceb	never return results =/
2010-01-20T13:52:00.000Z	owen	oceb: What version of Koha?
2010-01-20T13:52:00.000Z	oceb	3.0.5
2010-01-20T13:57:00.000Z	owen	Are you referring to the "publication date range" option?
2010-01-20T13:58:00.000Z	oceb	exactly! :D
2010-01-20T13:59:00.000Z	oceb	when i put a date p.e. "1998" or "-2009" or "1997-" it doesn't return results
2010-01-20T13:59:00.000Z	oceb	but without a date, it returns...
2010-01-20T13:59:00.000Z	owen	I assume other searches are working okay?
2010-01-20T13:59:00.000Z	oceb	yeah
2010-01-20T14:00:00.000Z	owen	Maybe someone else here can verify: Does the publication date search work by looking at 008?
2010-01-20T14:01:00.000Z	oceb	uhmmm
2010-01-20T14:01:00.000Z	oceb	how i can do a date search on 008 ?
2010-01-20T14:02:00.000Z	owen	oceb: I thought the publication date range search *did* search on the date in 008, but I'm hoping someone else here can tell me if that's correct
2010-01-20T14:03:00.000Z	oceb	=O
2010-01-20T14:04:00.000Z	oceb	I thought that search was on the field 260c
2010-01-20T14:06:00.000Z	owen	260c can contain non-numeric data, so you can't ask a computer to do numeric comparisons on it without attempting to sanitize it.
2010-01-20T14:06:00.000Z	owen	I thought the pub date search worked with 008 because of that.
2010-01-20T14:08:00.000Z	schuster	I can't verify but from my experience with Bib dates so far depending I suspect it is coming from the biblio.copyrightdate or biblioitems, but I'm not sure
2010-01-20T14:08:00.000Z	oceb	=o
2010-01-20T14:08:00.000Z	oceb	omg
2010-01-20T14:08:00.000Z	schuster	where that is being derived from and scrubbed to a single number.  I have not compared that, but will take a look.
2010-01-20T14:09:00.000Z	oceb	i think 99% of my books doesn't have a date in 008 >.<
2010-01-20T14:09:00.000Z	oceb	i'll test one, im putting a date on a book and now im reindexing
2010-01-20T14:19:00.000Z	oceb	omg
2010-01-20T14:19:00.000Z	oceb	it works!
2010-01-20T14:19:00.000Z	oceb	thanks owen :)
2010-01-20T14:20:00.000Z	oceb	now i need to put all dates from 260c to 008 =(
2010-01-20T14:22:00.000Z	owen	oceb: sounds like a job for a Perl guru
2010-01-20T14:24:00.000Z	* owen	thinks we had to do the same thing at one point, but it wasn't me that did it
2010-01-20T14:24:00.000Z	schuster	so it is pulling the date from the 008 - do you know is that how it got the information for the biblio.copyrightdate as well?
2010-01-20T14:26:00.000Z	* chris_n	heads off to fix a naughty win32 box
2010-01-20T14:26:00.000Z	schuster	shame on that box... ;)
2010-01-20T14:27:00.000Z	schuster	Owen - I want to thank you again for your help last week..  I'm really excited about the possibilities, now I just have to do something with it!
2010-01-20T14:27:00.000Z	owen	Sure thing schuster, I know you'd asked me about it before and I'm glad you pestered me about it
2010-01-20T14:27:00.000Z	Ropuch	Hm, I need to fix 008 with dates from 260c too
2010-01-20T14:28:00.000Z	Ropuch	This means some perl exercisies ;>
2010-01-20T14:32:00.000Z	jwagner	owen, you're talking about the 008 positions 7-10 for the pubyear, correct?
2010-01-20T14:32:00.000Z	owen	Yes
2010-01-20T14:32:00.000Z	jwagner	Thanks.  I have a site that's getting data converted by Marcive right now -- a timely reminder to send them to make sure that's getting filled in.
2010-01-20T14:38:00.000Z	oceb	wow
2010-01-20T14:38:00.000Z	oceb	not everithing is perl :)
2010-01-20T14:39:00.000Z	oceb	here in my library we have some code written in php to modifiy both marc and marcxml
2010-01-20T14:40:00.000Z	oceb	but I am learning Perl little by little with koha :D
2010-01-20T14:49:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	oceb: :'(
2010-01-20T14:49:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	learning PERL with koha is a hard school
2010-01-20T14:50:00.000Z	schuster	MarcEdit again might be able to help in that job...  I know I've used it's find x and place it in y feature several times.  Don't know how it would work on a leader/008 field.
2010-01-20T14:51:00.000Z	chris_n	bye chris_n2
2010-01-20T14:51:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	schuster++
2010-01-20T14:51:00.000Z	schuster	Question to the list - has anyone else seen this?  http://bagno.be/localcovers.html  - would it still work?
2010-01-20T14:52:00.000Z	oceb	hdl_laptop : yeah.... when i come here, i have no idea of what is perl :S
2010-01-20T14:54:00.000Z	oceb	perl is... powerfull but... some complicated to beginners :D Php is friendly with beginners :) Anyway im happy with koha and my newbie-knowledge of perl
2010-01-20T14:56:00.000Z	schuster	interesting regarding the 008 - biblios.copyrightdate comes from the 260c though in the database NOT the 008.
2010-01-20T14:56:00.000Z	schuster	I just ran a test.
2010-01-20T15:06:00.000Z	schuster	chris - just went through the git presentation - it is powerful - glad you understand it!!!
2010-01-20T15:07:00.000Z	owen	That's what I like about git: I can get stuff done with it, and people smarter than me can do magic with it.
2010-01-20T15:07:00.000Z	schuster	magic - kinda like owen the wizard with css ;)
2010-01-20T15:08:00.000Z	schuster	I just did some further testing and biblios.copyrightdate - scrubs everything except the first set of numbers. ie 2010, [p2009] in copyrightdate shows 2010, with [p2009], 2010 shows 2009...
2010-01-20T15:10:00.000Z	schuster	When searching what is displayed on the bib screen is the copyrightdate field so in the example above 2010, then 2009 not the full MARC representation.
2010-01-20T15:36:00.000Z	schuster	ok new question for the techies.  I may also post it to the koha-devel list for responses.  I have 53,000 pictures of students on a remote server.
2010-01-20T15:37:00.000Z	schuster	I tried to scp them in, but guess what there are limitations, so I'm thinking of setting up a cron job to setup the fileshare on the windows box, and then issue a set of scp commands once a week in the middle of the night to copy them over.
2010-01-20T15:37:00.000Z	schuster	then at the end of the cron would be the script I have to mass add them.
2010-01-20T15:38:00.000Z	schuster	Thoughts suggestions?  I'm a librarian here remember that when you respond. thanks....
2010-01-20T15:49:00.000Z	wizzyrea	hm, why do you have to add all 53k of them every week?
2010-01-20T15:54:00.000Z	wizzyrea	schuster: maybe I'm not understanding your need, you have 53k photos and you can only move X with scp, so you're thinking of moving batches of them? Or you have 53k photos that you need to add every week
2010-01-20T15:54:00.000Z	wizzyrea	or... something else
2010-01-20T15:55:00.000Z	owen	wizzyrea: Looks like he put more details into a message to koha-devel
2010-01-20T15:56:00.000Z	schuster	There are files put on a share for several departments to use of pictures of all the kids.  I never know when they get put there, and the dates on the files are the dates they are taken by the photographer
2010-01-20T15:56:00.000Z	schuster	hence the reason for loading ALL of them.
2010-01-20T15:57:00.000Z	schuster	If there are problems with pictures the librarian lets me know and I inform the powers that be to adjust the photo names etc... to make them match correctly.  We use the photos with the grade book program, and lunchline.
2010-01-20T15:57:00.000Z	wizzyrea	Ah, sorry I didn't look at my list mail
2010-01-20T15:58:00.000Z	schuster	sorry I was somewhat brief here in my description.
2010-01-20T16:00:00.000Z	wizzyrea	it's too bad it's a windows server, you could rsync
2010-01-20T16:03:00.000Z	chris_n	you can still rsync
2010-01-20T16:03:00.000Z	chris_n	http://www.aboutmyip.com/About[…]App/DeltaCopy.jsp
2010-01-20T16:03:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I didn't realize there was a windows version ^.^
2010-01-20T16:04:00.000Z	wizzyrea	oh sweet, had no idea, thanks chris
2010-01-20T16:04:00.000Z	wizzyrea	chris_n
2010-01-20T16:04:00.000Z	chris_n	I use it to sync my main webradio broadcast server with the warm-standby box
2010-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	chris_n	schuster: you can do a share if you use samba
2010-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	wizzyrea	are you the king of shoehorning windows in to unix shoes?
2010-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	chris_n	but rsync is probably the thing here
2010-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	chris_n	wizzyrea: I like to see windows in a vbox frame inside of my gnome interface
2010-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	wizzyrea	LOL
2010-01-20T16:06:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I frankly can't stand to look at it anymore >.>
2010-01-20T16:07:00.000Z	chris_n	schuster: you can setup rsync on your koha box and deltacopy on your win32 box and away you go
2010-01-20T16:07:00.000Z	wizzyrea	that has other benefits too, right? Like, he might not have to do all 53k?
2010-01-20T16:07:00.000Z	chris_n	rsync will only pickup on the file changes as well (if you like) which will reduce the load on the network after the initial replication
2010-01-20T16:08:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yes, that's what I was thinking of
2010-01-20T16:08:00.000Z	chris_n	great minds think alike they say ;-)
2010-01-20T16:08:00.000Z	chris_n	or at least get stuck in the same rut
2010-01-20T16:08:00.000Z	wizzyrea	haha
2010-01-20T16:13:00.000Z	schuster	Thanks chris_n AGAIN!  I'll look into this...  I don't have control of the windows box only access to pull/copy from so will have to play with it.
2010-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	Hello, I have a questions addbiblio.pl not working
2010-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	the page is blank when it's loaded via the OPAC site
2010-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	* chris_n	shamelessly encourages a prospective Koha user to maintain their own installation of Koha
2010-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	is that directed at me?
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(chris_n)
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	erm, do you mean in the staff interface?
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yep, the staff interface
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	chris_n	mgcleveland: sorry, no :-)
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(thanks for the response)
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	haha, no worries
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	chris_n	but feel free to maintain your own as well :-)
2010-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	haha, I'm trying!
2010-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	but there's just so much perl spaghetti code!
2010-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	owen	mgcleveland_: What version of Koha? Does your browser display any javascript errors?
2010-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	mg do you have access to your koha error log?
2010-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yes I have access to the logs and there is no error
2010-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(no javascript errors either)
2010-01-20T16:23:00.000Z	wizzyrea	what browser are you using?
2010-01-20T16:23:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	firefox
2010-01-20T16:23:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	here's the weird thing
2010-01-20T16:23:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I have other instances on different servers, and this page works on them
2010-01-20T16:23:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	i've diffed the files and there is no difference in the files!
2010-01-20T16:23:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I assume there must be something wrong with  my config or database, but I jsut don't know where to start looking
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	schuster	Permissions on the file?
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	i have root on everything
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	oh, sorry
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	good cal
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	l
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	let me check
2010-01-20T16:25:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	only needs 755, right?
2010-01-20T16:27:00.000Z	wizzyrea	it's just blank?
2010-01-20T16:27:00.000Z	wizzyrea	apache errors?
2010-01-20T16:27:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I checked the apache logs, as well, but I'll do a re-check
2010-01-20T16:28:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(koha error log is blank)
2010-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	apache log has no errors pertaining to my session
2010-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	wizzyrea	it's got to be something obvious
2010-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	that's what I'm thinking
2010-01-20T16:29:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	but I can't put my finger on it
2010-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	like I said, I suspect some config or DB issue
2010-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	wizzyrea	do you have itypes defined?
2010-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	wizzyrea	have you been through the system preferences to set up a library?
2010-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	wizzyrea	2nd being more important probably
2010-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	let me see
2010-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	wizzyrea	(if you don't have a library, I don't think it will let you add bibs(
2010-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	wizzyrea	(it definitely won't let you add patrons)
2010-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(i'm a CS/programmer guy, so when it comes to the library aspects of the system I'm a little lost, but I'll try to hang :) )
2010-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	wizzyrea	we get that a lot :)
2010-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	haha
2010-01-20T16:31:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	so how can I see if a library exists?
2010-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	wizzyrea	more -> administration -> libraries and groups
2010-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	oh yes
2010-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	wizzyrea	should list them
2010-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	we have 7 branches listed
2010-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	wizzyrea	okies, not that...
2010-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	with no categories set, is this important?
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I'm taking it that you installed with the default data?
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	so you should have default categories and itypes
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yes I did, but we've added data since then
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I really apologize but I have a meeting in 15
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	Ah ok
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	np np
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	thank you so much for your help
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	we're ez
2010-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	i'll be back in a few!
2010-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	wizzyrea	ttyl :)
2010-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	wizzyrea	ttyl :)
2010-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	wizzyrea	eerks lol
2010-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	wizzyrea	bad typing, bad
2010-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	wizzyrea	so the koha.org vendor list page is worthless now, right?
2010-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I mean, it lists some
2010-01-20T16:42:00.000Z	schuster	Evidently from the discussion yesterday...
2010-01-20T16:42:00.000Z	wizzyrea	well, here's my task
2010-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I'm supposed to come up with a list of the major players in the Koha Community
2010-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea	and their significant contributions
2010-01-20T16:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea	which should be easy enough
2010-01-20T16:44:00.000Z	owen	wizzyrea: chris and nicomo have both done work analyzing the git logs to identify the primary contributors
2010-01-20T16:45:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yea I'm looking at it
2010-01-20T16:49:00.000Z	wizzyrea	http://stats.workbuffer.org/3.2.0.html among others
2010-01-20T16:51:00.000Z	owen	wizzyrea: I know PTFS Europe has applied to appear on the list (ages ago) and more recently Mill Run Technology Solutions
2010-01-20T16:52:00.000Z	owen	Who knows if others have applied and either gotten no response or gave up because the submission form is broken.
2010-01-20T16:54:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yea... mason still works at katipo?
2010-01-20T16:56:00.000Z	wizzyrea	chris_n who do you work for?
2010-01-20T16:57:00.000Z	jwagner	gmcharlt, online?
2010-01-20T16:57:00.000Z	magnus	libriotech should be listed, but i havn't bothered to apply yet...
2010-01-20T17:02:00.000Z	masonj	wizzyrea: officially, i work for KohaAloha (my own company), but i do work as a contractor to Katipo ;)
2010-01-20T17:02:00.000Z	wizzyrea	(I know, I should know this)

2010-01-20T17:25:00.000Z	brendan	glad that I plan for silly things like floods, in a place that only rains for a month out of the year
2010-01-20T17:25:00.000Z	sekjal	brendan:  definitely
2010-01-20T17:25:00.000Z	sekjal	I remember waking up at 4am to my apartment flooding.  Mad dash across a squishy carpet to get my CPU off the floor

2010-01-20T17:51:00.000Z	owen	I'd do like schuster if I had his weather
2010-01-20T18:09:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	huh, http://api.jquery.com/ changed from mediawiki to wordpress for their CMS.
2010-01-20T18:18:00.000Z	jwagner	gmcharlt, still around?
2010-01-20T18:18:00.000Z	gmcharlt	jwagner: what's up?
2010-01-20T18:19:00.000Z	jwagner	I think I remember you saying you were going to push a bunch of patches to the current head -- has that happened?
2010-01-20T18:19:00.000Z	jwagner	One of our developers wants to get the latest head with all the patches/bugfixes.
2010-01-20T18:20:00.000Z	gmcharlt	look for it over the weekend
2010-01-20T18:20:00.000Z	jwagner	OK, I'll tell him.  Thanks.
2010-01-20T18:20:00.000Z	gmcharlt	the dev can also take a gander at the biblibre 3.2_community branch
2010-01-20T18:24:00.000Z	jwagner	OK.
2010-01-20T18:26:00.000Z	chris	register trademarks??????
2010-01-20T18:27:00.000Z	chris	wizzyrea_: you might need to have a chat with your boss, i fear in order to move things along he is gonna start another set of worries
2010-01-20T18:27:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	erm... I think that was a list of things that a foundation could (but KUDOS won't, necessarily)
2010-01-20T18:27:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	do
2010-01-20T18:28:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	don't read too much into it
2010-01-20T18:28:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	he's in agreement
2010-01-20T18:28:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	more along the lines of "get a move on and get it done"
2010-01-20T18:29:00.000Z	chris	ppl need to be more careful with words is all im saying
2010-01-20T18:29:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	KUDOS doesn't have any interest that I know of to register any trademarks regarding koha
2010-01-20T18:30:00.000Z	sekjal	we have never mentioned trademarks at all in any of the discussions I've been in on
2010-01-20T18:30:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	he's an administrator, he is simply referring to the things a foundation *can* do
2010-01-20T18:30:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	and in order to do them, you must have the foundation
2010-01-20T18:30:00.000Z	chris	cool, now anyone who reads the irc logs knows that, but anyone who reads the mailing list could be confused into thinking KUDOS is the foundation
2010-01-20T18:31:00.000Z	sekjal	that's easy enough to fix... one sec
2010-01-20T18:31:00.000Z	chris	thanks sekjal
2010-01-20T18:31:00.000Z	chris	its always easier to stop arguments before they start :)
2010-01-20T18:32:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	rather, a non profit 501c3 agency
2010-01-20T18:33:00.000Z	Ropuch	Evening #koha

2010-01-20T19:00:00.000Z	* chris_n	takes a deep breath and presses the 'send' button
2010-01-20T19:01:00.000Z	chris_n	perhaps /me should have read the buffer first :-)
2010-01-20T19:03:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	heh
2010-01-20T19:04:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	jim's grown, he can take it, though I'm sure that he didn't actually mean it in the way it's being read
2010-01-20T19:04:00.000Z	* chris_n	has had that happen before too
2010-01-20T19:05:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	he said the magic word "trademark"
2010-01-20T19:05:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	and "foundation"
2010-01-20T19:05:00.000Z	* wizzyrea_	shudders
2010-01-20T19:05:00.000Z	chris_n	the community is a bit sensitive atm
2010-01-20T19:05:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	heh, yea
2010-01-20T19:07:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	and by "sure" I know that he knows about the HLT/Official Foundation situation, more importantly comprehends the importance of that effort, and even more importantly respects that there is a need for it
2010-01-20T19:07:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	and you all don't know this, but he's set up several non profit foundations in his career
2010-01-20T19:08:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	*helped to set up
2010-01-20T19:08:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	yea, he's my boss, but he's not a nub.
2010-01-20T19:09:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	he is, and we are, committed to the principles of free software, and we have every interest in seeing Koha succeed.
2010-01-20T19:09:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	there. I'm done.

2010-01-20T19:36:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	owen: what do you think about the following screenshot, how can we make this display better
2010-01-20T19:36:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	http://screencast.com/t/M2RlNTY0
2010-01-20T19:36:00.000Z	jwagner	That just made my afternoon!
2010-01-20T19:37:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	the items display is what I'm referring to
2010-01-20T19:37:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	on bibs that have lots of items, the results list is very... icky
2010-01-20T19:37:00.000Z	owen	To say the least
2010-01-20T19:37:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	or maybe that's fixed in more recent versions
2010-01-20T19:37:00.000Z	owen	Not that I know of
2010-01-20T19:37:00.000Z	jwagner	I'm not owen, but I think it would be better if the items list was just another line after the bib display instead of in a separate column.  That would give it a much wider table cell to run across.
2010-01-20T19:38:00.000Z	chris_n	@quote add jwagner thinks true joy is not wanting to do a telecon, and finding out the other person has forgotten about it & left for the day :-)
2010-01-20T19:38:00.000Z	munin	chris_n: The operation succeeded.  Quote #51 added.
2010-01-20T19:38:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	well, it shows several things that it may not need to
2010-01-20T19:38:00.000Z	jwagner	chris_n, you had to do that, didn't you :-(
2010-01-20T19:38:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	why does it show the call number for checked out items, for example
2010-01-20T19:38:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	it's out, you're not going to find it
2010-01-20T19:39:00.000Z	owen	...not that that buys you much space
2010-01-20T19:39:00.000Z	richard	hi
2010-01-20T19:40:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	true, but what if you 1. used the library short name instead of full name, 2. removed the call number 3. changed date due: to Due only for on loan items
2010-01-20T19:40:00.000Z	jwagner	wizzyrea, this is staff side, correct?  Is there any value to even showing the call numbers at this stage?  Maybe just a Library A (7 copies), Library B (2 copies) etc.
2010-01-20T19:41:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	well I was wondering about that too
2010-01-20T19:41:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	I think that for AVAILABLE items it doesn't hurt to show a lot of info
2010-01-20T19:41:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	but for checked out or lost items... just as well to go to the bib detail
2010-01-20T19:41:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	to find out the dilly
2010-01-20T19:41:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	yes, thsi is the staff side
2010-01-20T19:42:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	oh and you've got shelving location in there too
2010-01-20T19:42:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	so axe that
2010-01-20T19:42:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	so, as an example
2010-01-20T19:42:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	on loan: Baldwin, Due 01/28/2010
2010-01-20T19:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	Basehor, Due XXX
2010-01-20T19:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	etc
2010-01-20T19:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	1-2 lines instead of 6
2010-01-20T19:44:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	i'm more just curious if anyone else has an opinion on how it can be made better
2010-01-20T19:44:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	I know it's not a priority
2010-01-20T19:44:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	i'm willing to try to fix it myself, but don't want to do anything that would make people upset
2010-01-20T19:44:00.000Z	wizzyrea_	fix/change
2010-01-20T19:45:00.000Z	owen	Needs a wider discussion
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	wizzyrea_ you still there?
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yep
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	ok I'm back
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	do you remember what we were talking about?
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	wizzyrea	there are more people around now, you might go over your issue
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	wizzyrea	again
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	wizzyrea	for their benefit
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	wizzyrea	but yes, I remember :)
2010-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	will do
2010-01-20T19:47:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	In a nutshell, my addbiblio.pl page is not working
2010-01-20T19:47:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	it works on other instances of Koha I have and the files, when diffed, are identical
2010-01-20T19:47:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	this leads me to believe it's a config or DB problem
2010-01-20T19:48:00.000Z	* jwagner	thinks "Curses, foiled again!" Others at the site called me to pick up the telecon!
2010-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	sooooooooo
2010-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	any ideas?
2010-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	wizzyrea	we know that you have libraries, and you're sure you have item types
2010-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	right, we've got branches
2010-01-20T19:53:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	as for the item types, let me check
2010-01-20T19:57:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	well as I said, I'm a computer person
2010-01-20T19:57:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	hence the lag on figuring out the library stuff
2010-01-20T19:59:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	wizzyrea, could I find that by exploring the mysql DB?
2010-01-20T20:00:00.000Z	wizzyrea	more -> administration -> Item Types
2010-01-20T20:00:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I == idiot
2010-01-20T20:00:00.000Z	wizzyrea	mine looks like this, for example
2010-01-20T20:00:00.000Z	wizzyrea	http://screencast.com/t/ZWE1YmVkN
2010-01-20T20:00:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yep, we've got 3
2010-01-20T20:01:00.000Z	wizzyrea	okies
2010-01-20T20:01:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	so we've got branches and item types
2010-01-20T20:01:00.000Z	wizzyrea	and you've got nothing in your koha error log and nothing in your apache log, and addbiblio.pl won't come up
2010-01-20T20:01:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	correct
2010-01-20T20:01:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	you want to see a screenshot of addbiblio?
2010-01-20T20:02:00.000Z	wizzyrea	how are you getting to it, more -> cataloging -> new record?
2010-01-20T20:02:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I click on the "Add MARC" link
2010-01-20T20:02:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	it's under "Cataloging"
2010-01-20T20:03:00.000Z	wizzyrea	ok, if you do more -> cataloging -> new record what happens?
2010-01-20T20:03:00.000Z	wizzyrea	this is what mine looks like: http://screencast.com/t/ODVlMzg1Z
2010-01-20T20:03:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	same thing happens
2010-01-20T20:03:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	also, I think we may be using different versions of Koha
2010-01-20T20:04:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	let me see what mine is right quick
2010-01-20T20:04:00.000Z	wizzyrea	seems likely, in which case I probably can't help you
2010-01-20T20:04:00.000Z	wizzyrea	if you do more -> about koha what does it say in koha version
2010-01-20T20:06:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I'm wondering if you don't have frameworks (though this may not be germane if you are not using 3.0 at least)
2010-01-20T20:06:00.000Z	wizzyrea	http://screencast.com/t/ODVlMzg1Z
2010-01-20T20:06:00.000Z	wizzyrea	because when you click the button, you should see frameworks
2010-01-20T20:06:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I have frameworks (I'm pretty sure)
2010-01-20T20:07:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	when I go to biblio framework, I have default populated
2010-01-20T20:07:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I"m curious, can you add members/patrons?
2010-01-20T20:08:00.000Z	wizzyrea	to this install?
2010-01-20T20:08:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	trying...
2010-01-20T20:08:00.000Z	wizzyrea	hi paul
2010-01-20T20:09:00.000Z	jwagner	paul_p, what are you doing online this late?  (Not that it's not good to see you, but....)
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	wizzyrea, I can add patrons
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	paul_p	hi jwagner. Just updating some personal pictures & docs, and auto-logged on irc ;-)
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	wizzyrea	then it's not something to do with javascript, probably
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yeah I didn't think it was
2010-01-20T20:10:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	no browser complaints, anyway
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	wizzyrea	what version were you running?
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	well I can't figure that damn thing out!
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I think it's 2.2.9
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	wizzyrea	Ah
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yea, I can't help you sorry lol I only know 3
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	balls!
2010-01-20T20:11:00.000Z	wizzyrea	hahaha
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	wizzyrea	curious why you'd want to run 2.2.9 though
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	this is driving me crazy!
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	Not sure why we're on the older version
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I have an instance of 3 running
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	but this is our production instance that has the problem
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	* wizzyrea	sings "it's much beeeettter"
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	jwagner	paul_p, OK, you're forgiven :-)
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I know!
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I know it's better!
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	wizzyrea	:)
2010-01-20T20:12:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	maybe we didn't want to risk the problems that always come with migration
2010-01-20T20:13:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yes, librarians like to hold on to that one
2010-01-20T20:13:00.000Z	wizzyrea	sorry I've never run 2.2.9
2010-01-20T20:13:00.000Z	wizzyrea	well, that's not true exactly
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	also, we're serving ours in Persian
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	wizzyrea	but I've never run it seriously
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	and there is no translation for 3.0
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(i think)
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	wizzyrea	Ahh, well that would do it too
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yeah
2010-01-20T20:14:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	balls again!
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	so is 2.2.9 not supported any more?
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	wizzyrea	you could always get someone to do a translation, or help get one started
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	we actually are working on it
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	wizzyrea	Yay!
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I think my boss is dealing with that aspect of the project
2010-01-20T20:15:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yeah
2010-01-20T20:16:00.000Z	wizzyrea	it is, but there are a lot more people using 3.0.x than 2.2.9
2010-01-20T20:16:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	shoot
2010-01-20T20:16:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	well I can start migrating the data to our sandbox 3.0.x instance and see how that goes
2010-01-20T20:19:00.000Z	chris	back
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	chris	and in the keynote .. by glynn moody ... its awesome so far
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	chris
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	do you know much about 2.2.x?
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	wizzyrea	(yea, if anybody were to know about it, it would likely be chris)
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	woo hoo!
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	chris	cant really talk at the moment, busy listening
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	oh ok
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	chris	i do know you shouldnt use it
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	chris	:)
2010-01-20T20:20:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	i know i know!
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	let me know when you have a minute, I have a weird situation
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	chris	unfortunately im at a conference all day, and all tomorrow
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	chris	so drop me an email
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	chris	chrisbigballofwax.co.nz
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	ok, yeah that would be great
2010-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	thanks!
2010-01-20T20:22:00.000Z	* chris_n	designs a cool looking new search box for his opac header and tries desperately to get the css to behave :-P
2010-01-20T20:23:00.000Z	* wizzyrea	smacks chris_n's CSS into submission. Get! In! Your! Place!
2010-01-20T20:23:00.000Z	owen	If only smacking it helped.
2010-01-20T20:23:00.000Z	chris	http://www.lca2010.org.nz/prog[…]chedule/video/mfc
2010-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	jwagner	owen, it depends on the size of the baseball bat (or other implement) you use to DO the smacking :-)
2010-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	chris	if anyone wants to listen to glynn explain why sharing is so important
2010-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	wizzyrea	me me oh me
2010-01-20T20:29:00.000Z	chris_n	owen: what are the 'translControl' div's ?
2010-01-20T20:30:00.000Z	chris_n	wizzyrea: that must have worked, 'cause it just dropped into place ;-)
2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	chris	jim kent, saved us from the human genes being patented ... free software ftw
2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	wizzyrea	my coworkers claim I have an aura...
2010-01-20T20:31:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I didn't know it worked over the internet too.
2010-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	wizzyrea	an aura that makes computers behave in my presence, that is.
2010-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I don't believe it but eh
2010-01-20T20:32:00.000Z	owen	chris_n: I'm not exactly sure what they do, but they're related to googleindictransliteration.js
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	chris	thats freaking awesome, GNU/Linux saved (most) of the human genome from gene patents
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	hey wizzy
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yes?
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	would addbiblio.pl be the same code in 3.0.x and 2.2.x?
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	wizzyrea	i'm guessing no
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	hmmm
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	that's weird
2010-01-20T20:33:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	because I think my working instance is 3.0.x
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	wizzyrea	hard to say without knowing for sure
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yeah it is
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	and I diffed that with my production instance and they were the same
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	aaahh!
2010-01-20T20:34:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	(no revelation)
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	* chris_n	thinks his genes are copyrighted in any case ;-)
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	wizzyrea	maybe the revelation is that addbiblio.pl needs to be reverted to a 2.2.9 version
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	hahaha
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	chris_n	what she said
2010-01-20T20:35:00.000Z	chris_n	I find it highly unlikely that the two would be the same
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I'm sure I have the addbiblio.pl of the correct instance
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	i just don't know which version the production instance is!~
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	and I can't find it anywhere!
2010-01-20T20:36:00.000Z	wizzyrea	well... you have a weird problem, and an even wierder code congruency on possibly completely different versions
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	wizzyrea	that's just a recipe for wierdness if I've ever heard one
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	hahaha
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	is there anywhere in the source code/DB where I can see which version I have?
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	* wizzyrea	does not know 2.2.9
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	btw, we also have a weird theme, so everything is hard to find
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	what about in 3.0.x?
2010-01-20T20:37:00.000Z	wizzyrea	mg, which library do you work for?
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I'm suspicious that we actually are running 3.0.x
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	University of Arizona
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I'm a student
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	:)
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	chris_n	mgcleveland: you can try opening your production addbiblio.pl in a text editor and see if the version is noted there
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	wizzyrea	O.o Ah
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I have root access to the code
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	i'll just check the code directly
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	chris	go to the about.pl page
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	chris	http://your.staff.interface/cgi-bin/koha/about.pl
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	chris!
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	nice!
2010-01-20T20:38:00.000Z	* chris_n	jumps back into the CSS pool for more fun
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	chris	and/or look in the db
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	it is 2.2.9
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I think our theme has no link to about.pl
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	>(
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	chris	systempreferences table has a version number (if its 3.0.0 or later)
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	wizzyrea	aside, I didn't realize uni of ariz. was doing much with koha
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	it's a special project
2010-01-20T20:39:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I'm not working on the library's main site
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	it's a grant we've been working on for a few years
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	partnering with Kabul University in Afghanistan
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	chris	what you should do
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	chris	is get someone working on translate.koha.org
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	we do have them doing that
2010-01-20T20:40:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	at least we started on it
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	wizzyrea	and move it to 3.0 (or 3.2, which is relatively imminent)
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	we're a little overwhelmed with work and fulfilling the grant expectations
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	chris	yeah
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	agreed
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	chris	http://translate.koha.org/fa/  hasnt changed in a while
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	not farsi
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	persian
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	or is it listed as farsi?
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I can't remember
2010-01-20T20:41:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I don't do the farsi stuff
2010-01-20T20:42:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	my boss and some coworkers do that
2010-01-20T20:42:00.000Z	chris	that is persian
2010-01-20T20:42:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	my favorite languages are C, C++, etc...
2010-01-20T20:42:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	:)
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	chris	i think its a bit late now, but i suspect this a good example of why getting involved in the community early vs later is a good idea
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	yeah
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yes, definitely, a very good example
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	well this was working for a long time
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	chris	*nod*
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	and suddenly isn't
2010-01-20T20:43:00.000Z	wizzyrea	... what changed?
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I'm not sure
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	chris	and if it had been committed back (the translation etc) then 3.0 would have it
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	I wish i knew!
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	oh you're talking about the translation
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	chris	and any code mods
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	is that the project that uses pootle?
2010-01-20T20:44:00.000Z	chris	silos = bad
2010-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	chris	mgcleveland_: yeah we use pootle for translating koha
2010-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	* chris	is currently translation manager
2010-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	gotcha, yeah like I said I'm not involved with the translation part
2010-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	maybe you've spoken with my boss then, I know he contacted someone about it
2010-01-20T20:45:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	Yan Han is his name
2010-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	wizzyrea	do a lot of people have superlibrarian access? or access to the system?
2010-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	owen	Proof that silos are bad: http://www.theconcentrium.com/[…]ns/Silo/00cap.jpg
2010-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	nope

2010-01-20T20:46:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	haha, a celebrity!
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	ok guys, well I appreciate your help

2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	wizzyrea	well, i encourage you to think about what has changed
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	wizzyrea	have a beer, relax your mind, the answer will come
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	wizzyrea: agreed
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	haha
2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	wizzyrea	:)
2010-01-20T20:48:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	it's only 1:45pm!
2010-01-20T20:48:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	3.75 hours to go!
2010-01-20T20:48:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	haha
2010-01-20T20:48:00.000Z	mgcleveland_	adios!
2010-01-20T20:49:00.000Z	CGI487	hi everybody
2010-01-20T20:49:00.000Z	CGI487	I am trying to make zebra run as a daemon on suse linux but still can't
2010-01-20T20:50:00.000Z	CGI487	anyone here install koha 3.0.5 on suse linux ?
2010-01-20T20:53:00.000Z	owen	Do the CGI* people have no patience, or are they more prone to flaky connections?
2010-01-20T20:54:00.000Z	chris	both
2010-01-20T21:11:00.000Z	chris_n	here's a screenshot of some of the opac customizations I've been working on for the library here
2010-01-20T21:11:00.000Z	chris_n	http://www.screencast.com/t/ZjU0OGRiNz
2010-01-20T21:12:00.000Z	wizzyrea	oh that's beautiful chris_n
2010-01-20T21:12:00.000Z	owen	Very nice
2010-01-20T21:13:00.000Z	chris_n	tnx
2010-01-20T21:13:00.000Z	chris_n	and especially to owen's blogs and the npl website (which I have combed through with firebug to pickup tips)
2010-01-20T21:14:00.000Z	owen	I wonder if PTFS will continue "Koha Express?"
2010-01-20T21:14:00.000Z	owen	On the one hand, it seems to fill a need for small libraries who don't want to invest too much
2010-01-20T21:14:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I hope they at least give it a different name
2010-01-20T21:14:00.000Z	owen	On the other hand, PTFS doesn't have to compete in the same way LibLime [felt they] did
2010-01-20T21:15:00.000Z	wizzyrea	always makes me think of coffee
2010-01-20T21:16:00.000Z	sekjal	I'm still keen to get a turnkeylinux application of Koha going on.  Download, slap on some (virtual) machine somewhere, and play
2010-01-20T21:16:00.000Z	sekjal	I think the difficulty is in the details with that, though
2010-01-20T21:20:00.000Z	wizzyrea	yes, I like that idea too sekjal
2010-01-20T21:21:00.000Z	wizzyrea	or launch that puppy to the cloud
2010-01-20T21:22:00.000Z	wizzyrea	they have super funky music on the webcast from linux conf AU
2010-01-20T21:22:00.000Z	wizzyrea	I dig
2010-01-20T21:24:00.000Z	chris_n	looks like owen 's running a patch mill today :-)
2010-01-20T21:26:00.000Z	wizzyrea	owen++
2010-01-20T21:29:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	gmcharlt: I wonder whether Kyle patches for patroncards and rotating collections should get into Community.
2010-01-20T21:29:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	It was sent on patches.
2010-01-20T21:29:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	And was welcome.
2010-01-20T21:29:00.000Z	gmcharlt	hdl_laptop: I agree, it should
2010-01-20T21:29:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	ok.
2010-01-20T21:29:00.000Z	hdl_laptop	it looks smooth enough to enter.
