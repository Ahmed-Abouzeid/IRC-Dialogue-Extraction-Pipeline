2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	balton		I'm having a pretty weird problem - I installed Windows & Ubuntu on a dualboot and when i was in windows, the system reboot all of a sudden..when grub came up it booted into ubuntu, but i got a crc error..so i rebooted the system, and then all of a sudden it said "No operating system found" and grub didn't come up - So i tried putting in the ubuntu install disc again, but again, when uncompressing linux, i got a crc error..I also tried a gen
2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	osvaldo	alexrait	sadly i don't have access to my hoary install at the moment, sorry.

2005-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	tatterdemalionpr	balton	could the hd be bad?
2005-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	hector_		i need lots of help can somebody help me???
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	Nafallo	hector_	just ask in the channel and people will probably answer...
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	kirt		Has anyone else been getting slow DNS lookups recently?  I've tried disabling ipv6 and my firewall.. neither had any effect.
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	balton	tatterdemalionpr	- I'm not sure...there are two drives in the box - a 40Gb with windows, and a 250Gb w/ a windows partition and linux
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	balton	tatterdemalionpr	- should i try disconecting the hard drives, and then booting off a livecd..?
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	hector_		i'm tryng to mount a fat partition and i can't do it
2005-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	spinifex		where is the log file for xorg?
2005-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	balton	tatterdemalionpr	- but i don't know how a bad hard drive would affect uncompressing linux off a livecd - doesn't the livecd not touch them at that point..?
2005-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	alexrait	osvaldo	it was just an example of course: :) I do use gaim..
2005-02-24T12:05:00.000Z	hector_		the first time that i can do it, i can't see the folders
2005-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	tatterdemalionpr	balton	bad cd?
2005-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	spinifex		does xorg keep a log file when you start up?
2005-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	tatterdemalionpr	balton	wrong cd drivers?
2005-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	bascule		bad RAM, bad IDE channels
2005-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	balton		i dont think so - i said i tried both ubuntu and a gentoo livecd, plus i've used both cds many times in the past..
2005-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	balton	bascule	- what does bad ide channels mean? like how would i fix that...
2005-02-24T12:07:00.000Z	tatterdemalionpr		new motherboard
2005-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	balton	tatterdemalionpr	- i see..
2005-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	tatterdemalionpr		but i doubt thats your probles, problem
2005-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	bascule		well, it's a sarcastic one really, bad IDE channels would need a new motherboard so let's hope not, ;)
2005-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	bascule	balton	^

2005-02-24T12:20:00.000Z	bascule		chown <you> ~/.ICEauthority
2005-02-24T12:20:00.000Z	thundrcleeze		thanks again, bascule
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	bascule		rm -f ~/.ICEauthority is an other way, up to ypu, np
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	balton		ok i'm back
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	bascule		how goes things balton
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	balton		i tried undoing the drives one by one, and it didn't fix it, but when i took out one of the sticks of ram it booted up the ubuntu install disk...now i'm goign to try putting the drives back in and hopefully it will work again
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	bascule		bad RAM of cource crc check at  the top of the BIOS POST
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	Funto		wow, hello
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	antibios		hello
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	bascule		hi, popular isn't it :)
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	Funto		yes lol, I suppose you all are Ubuntu users...
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	antibios		loving the ubuntu
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	bascule		good guess
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	Funto		hmm I'm new to this distrib, and I can say I'm new to Linux too
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	antibios		got a question that i wanted to ask before I start logging a bug report
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	AlphaXero		how do you de-link /dev/dvd from /media/cdrom0 ?
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	Funto		there still are problems with hardware :(
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	valdez	Funto	what kind of hardware?
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	Slant	AlphaXero	Take a look in /etc/fstab.
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	Funto		1st, the modem, then, the printer
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	antibios		my sounds keeps breaking and I just wanted to check that it isn't a hardware problem
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	Funto		and the scanner too..., :(
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	antibios		Also give me the error: ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:549:(snd_pcm_hw_start) SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_START failed: Broken pipe
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	AlphaXero		i forgot the cmd, ln something
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	valdez	Funto	the modem seems to work though? :p
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	Funto		I don't understand...Ubuntu is based on Knoppix isn't it? So why does Knoppix recognize hardware Ubuntu doesn't?
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	Funto	valdez	>> no :(, It's a SpeedTouch USB
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	bascule		arrrrgh modem from hell ...
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	jdub	Funto	no, it's not
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	AlphaXero		slant, /dev/dvd isnt in there
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	jdub	Funto	the warty livecd was based on morphix
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	Funto		and Morphix on Knoppix?
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	jdub	Funto	the latest hoary test livecds are based on a new system, and recognise all the hardware that the installed system does, loosely now
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	Funto		wow
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	valdez		Hoary works pretty good for me right now .. aka kicks ass
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	Funto		a new system...a new distrib?
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	jdub		no, a new livecd infrastructure
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	Funto		?
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	bascule		i got a SpeedTouch USB to work once, rebooted and it never worked again
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	AlphaXero		ah ok, its sudo ln -s /media/cdrom0 /dev/dvd <---how do i undo this?
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	bascule		tm -f /media/cdrom0
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	Funto	bascule	>> it happened to me too ^^ but with Mandrake
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	bascule		rm*
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	valdez		never liked usb modems ..
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	Funto		there is a script in Kaella
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	AlphaXero		that removes the link bascule?
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	bascule	Funto	the modem sucks completely, get a router, sorry but that is the way it is ..:(
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	Funto		Kaella is a french versio nof Knoppix, and that script permits it to connect in 30 seconds...
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	bascule	AlphaXero	yes
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	Funto	bascule	>> in fact I managed to make the system recognize the modem, and it thinks it works, but...it doesn't :D
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	bascule	AlphaXero	oops rm -f /dev/dvd
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	randabis		hoary pissed me off earlier :p I did an update and it brought back that awful debian menu
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	AlphaXero		ok thanks bascule
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	valdez		lol
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	jdub	randabis	remove menu-xdg
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	godo		me too
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	bascule	AlphaXero	/media/cdrom0 will be a directory anyway
2005-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	bascule	Funto	I think with 2.4 kernels it was fine, 2.6 forget about it
2005-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	Funto		hmm, however the Kaella script works either with 2.4 and with 2.6...
2005-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	bascule	AlphaXero	it is ln -s /dev/cdroms/cdrom0 /dev/dvd, or /dev/hdc /dev/dvd, or /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd
2005-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	Funto		(where could I dl Hoary?)
2005-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	bascule	Funto	perhaps they have a direct line to Benoit Papillault
2005-02-24T12:34:00.000Z	Funto		a...direct line? you mean...?
2005-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	bascule		he perhaps was a devel there ...
2005-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	Funto		ah you mean in Kaella?
2005-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	bascule		yes
2005-02-24T12:35:00.000Z	Funto		I don't know, the fact is that it is a french distribution and that my modem is widely used in France ^^
2005-02-24T12:36:00.000Z	bascule		UK too, wanadoo give them out like candy, cause that's all they are worth ;)
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	cindux_		back :P
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	tweek888		is there a compile guide anywhere? i reall cant figure it out :(
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	cindux_		Totem still brokey..
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	tweek888		really*

2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	tezza		how would i go about getting the functionality from my touchpad on my laptop so when i press in on it it performs a click ?
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	valdez	cindux	what's up with totem? mine's stable
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	godo		if have deinstall it
2005-02-24T12:37:00.000Z	cindux_	tezza	are you talking about that little black/grey pad?
2005-02-24T12:38:00.000Z	cindux_	godo	try right clicking it, you should have the remove option
2005-02-24T12:38:00.000Z	godo		ok
2005-02-24T12:39:00.000Z	balton	bascule	- thanks for the help, looks like it's all good again
2005-02-24T12:39:00.000Z	randabis	jdub	removing that also removes kde lol
2005-02-24T12:39:00.000Z	balton	bascule	- i'm pissed off that the stick of RAM is bad already, i bought it at xmas!
2005-02-24T12:40:00.000Z	cindux_		lol, i have a bunch of sticks of pc133 you can have :D, er damnt
2005-02-24T12:40:00.000Z	bascule	balton	send it back
2005-02-24T12:40:00.000Z	Funto		is it possible to install Ubuntu Hoary on the DD from the live-cd?
2005-02-24T12:40:00.000Z	cindux_		anyone know how to msg nickserv, to "login", keeps saying cindux is in use by another but i dont know command, to verify i am cindux
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	bascule		/msg nickser ident <pssword>
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	randabis	Funto	theoretically you could
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	cindux_		ah
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	bascule		/msg nickserv ident <password>
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	randabis		it'd be kinda like installing gentoo from a livecd
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	cindux_		thought it was identify, alright brb
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	tobbe		msg NickServ IDENTIFY <password>
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	bascule		ident identify ...
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	tezza	cindux_	yer, it's a laptop and usually if you press it it acts as a click
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	Funto		And is there a script to install it, like under Knoppix?
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	randabis		no
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	cindux		woo, thankey
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	randabis		that's why I said theoretically
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	godo		no icons for Trash and Desktop
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	randabis		you'd have to improvise your own way to install ubuntu from a livecd
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	netmonk		am i doing somethig wrong or is it a bug that every time I start synaptic the settings are back to proxy I used some time ago?
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	randabis		I think it would be somewhat similar to installing gentoo, you'd need to chroot, etc
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	godo		how to fix it,cindux?
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	cindux		huh?
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	Funto		ok thx randabis
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	bascule	cindux	sets mode +e no new memos? If so good
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	cindux		= /
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	bascule		23:44 -!- Mode change [+e]  for user bascule, 23:44 -MemoServ(MemoServ@services.)- You have no new memos
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	cindux		oh, yes i saw that, lol
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	bascule		coolyou are in .. :)
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	cindux		:D
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	godo		how i get the icons Trash and Desktop back?
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	cindux		do you mean the desktop icons ?, or the ones in the bottom menu
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	Funto		with gconf-editor I think
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	godo		on the left
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	Funto		if you're talking about the icons on the desktop
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	godo		there is only a thumbnail, on the down panel
2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	tweek888		is there a guide to basic compileing?
2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	bascule		./configure && make && sudo make install <-- that easy
2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	tweek888		can you explain sudo?
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	cindux		lol, is sudo an acronym ?
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	bascule		do as [S] uper [U] ser
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	tweek888		k
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	cindux		that cheap crap
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	Funto	bascule	>> but there isn't gcc on Ubuntu....
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	tweek888		well ive tried make and it says theres no makefile =\
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	bascule	Funto	oh there is I can assure you
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	cindux		this may be dumb, what is the difference between root & super user?
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	bascule		none
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	Funto		at least in my Hoary distrib, the package gcc isn't installed...
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	cindux		2 words for the same thing ?
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	Funto		(I wanted to say Warty)
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	cindux		so, when i type sudo su i'm basically asking for a session as root
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	bascule	Funto	not installed is none, not the same ... :)
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	cindux		aka super user?
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	bascule		yup, aka god aka ownz everything and everyone
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	cindux		woah, cool ^
2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	tobbe		If I've understand it right there can be many super users, and root is one of them_, ?

2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	cindux		maker of the linux kernel, at something university
2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	bascule		yes, he said that
2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	cindux		lol, cool name, who looks at a kid & says Linus
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	Firsti		Linus Torvalds was born in finland, me too :)
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	no many users can sudo but only ever one super user uid=0 root
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	Funto	tobbe	there is juste one superuser...
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	cindux		.. I wonder if Linus was born as Tommy
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	celerex		someone wanna tell me why ubuntu requires i have mpm-worker installed but can't have mpm-prefork as well for apache? But mod-php required mpm-prefork
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	Funto		and his name is root
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	tobbe		Ok
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	cindux		:O
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	hummm		sorry i know this is off topic, but this is a helpful channel and programers linger here too. How can one tell DDD to display struct members with names?
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	izo		how can i unpack compressed ubuntu mainmod1.mod file ?
2005-02-24T12:51:00.000Z	theine		hi, will libavcodeccvs eventually enter multiverse?
2005-02-24T12:52:00.000Z	tobbe	cindux	A Finnish mom and dad looks at a kid and says Linus ;)
2005-02-24T12:52:00.000Z	Funto	hummm	what is DDD?
2005-02-24T12:52:00.000Z	valdez		hrm su does not stand for super user really
2005-02-24T12:52:00.000Z	cindux		loll
2005-02-24T12:52:00.000Z	theine	valdez	it doesn't?
2005-02-24T12:52:00.000Z	tobbe		switch user
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	valdez		substitute user, ;)
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	theine		i see
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	hummm	Funto	it's a front end for gdb
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	valdez		it's not just for mr root
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	theine		nice to know
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	hummm		(not that it matters)
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	valdez		:)
2005-02-24T12:53:00.000Z	Funto		ok, so I can't help you hummm ^^, printf is your friend...:p
2005-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	tobbe		well, it does kind of matter... you can do 'su <what ever username>' to change to any user
2005-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	bascule		switch user or super user, hence sudo, maybe ..
2005-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	valdez		does anyone where I can find the homepage of totem?
2005-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	bascule		sudo bascule 'some task' also works though
2005-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	Funto		the page for Totem sends a 404 error :(, well I'm going to sleep, bye everybody, +

2005-02-24T12:57:00.000Z	tobbe		I'm trying to compile a program and get this message: Checking for C header file time.h... no, Did not find the header time.h, What do I have to apt-get to get time.h?
2005-02-24T12:59:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	depends what time.h it wants they exist for a few things, libc6-dev, glibc-dev
2005-02-24T01:00:00.000Z	nealmcb		how do I find out the status of a package in various ubuntu releases?  e.g. whether hplip is in hoary yet?  I.e. I'm looking for ubuntu versions of debian web pages like http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/hplip
2005-02-24T01:00:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	How do I find that out?
2005-02-24T01:01:00.000Z	bascule		find what out?, it's libc6-dev in this case
2005-02-24T01:02:00.000Z	tobbe		ok, thanks
2005-02-24T01:02:00.000Z	Lethorion		hi, how do I set it up so entrance is started at boot and not gdm?

2005-02-24T01:04:00.000Z	randabis	nealmcb	http://higgs.djpig.de/ubuntu/www/
2005-02-24T01:04:00.000Z	bascule		< bascule> tobbe: depends what time.h it wants they exist for a few things, could be glibc-linux-headers or a python package wxPythin
2005-02-24T01:05:00.000Z	kent		is there a way to make perl script executed from / in apache? i can execute them from cgi-bin, but i cant find any documents about running them from / instead :(
2005-02-24T01:06:00.000Z	bascule		stlport-STLPORT_5_0, howl-0.9.8:/usr/include/howl/salt/time.h
2005-02-24T01:07:00.000Z	tobbe		I'll try with stlport-dev
2005-02-24T01:07:00.000Z	bascule		yeah, it's about narrowing down what it needs
2005-02-24T01:07:00.000Z	nealmcb	randabis	thanks!!

2005-02-24T01:10:00.000Z	delltony		what did i just say :), it was never set
2005-02-24T01:10:00.000Z	bascule		su wants root password which doesn't exist, sudo su
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	I_Need_Help		sudo su
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS	bascule	sudo passwd root
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS	bascule	then you can use su -
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	bascule		or that

2005-02-24T01:15:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	Still can't find time.h I've got glibc, stlport and libc6 installed
2005-02-24T01:15:00.000Z	delltony		wonder k3b has to run with sudo k3b i can't get it to do the k3bsetup and add the root pass
2005-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	Lethorion		is it enough to just remove the gdm symlink in /etc/rc5.d and add a entrance symlink for it to run entrance and not run gdm?
2005-02-24T01:19:00.000Z	LonelyRat		hiya, how can i get aterm to use the font "bitstream vera sans mono" instead of an ugly bitmap font
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	what are you trying to build
2005-02-24T01:22:00.000Z	bascule	LonelyRat	I don't think aterm supports 2-bythe fonts, byte*
2005-02-24T01:22:00.000Z	felix_1		Hi all, apache2 cannot runs scripts (php; etc...) : "User not alowed to run scripts" : Someone knows what that means ?
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	LonelyRat		aww, xterm supports it, i thought aterm was based on xterm
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	spinifex		When I hit 'logout' in gnome, it takes about 5 minutes for it to actually show the dialog box where I can select shutdown/restart.  I think this may be caused by my graphics card not liking the dimming effect it's supposed to do.  I'm using Hoary.  Advice?
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	bascule		don't think any term does really konsole and gnome-terminal have a go but they look awful
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	spinifex		I already hit the button, still waiting for it to show
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	LonelyRat		xterm looks nice, but i can't get it transparent and tinted
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	bascule		xterm wont do those things no
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	spinifex		my chipset is very crappy, but I am able to play chromium and frozen bubble and armagetron straight from processor, very fast
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	I'm trying to build linuxdcpp
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	spinifex		ah, there it is, know how I can disable the effect or something?  I don't want to wait 5 minutes while it does nothing every time I want to shutdown, hmm, actually, once I've made it show the logout thing, it will quickly load it again., any reason for this slowness?
2005-02-24T01:29:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	http://linuxdcpp.berlios.de
2005-02-24T01:29:00.000Z	spinifex		running out of batteries, brb
2005-02-24T01:29:00.000Z	felix_1		... sorry for re-asking: Apache2 cannot runs php scripts: "User not alowed to run scripts" : what that means ??? I am newbie in webserver instasllation-configuration
2005-02-24T01:30:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	needs a cvs checkout right?, <-- can't be bothered
2005-02-24T01:31:00.000Z	ultrahex		hmmmm PalmPilot Support ..
2005-02-24T01:33:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	yeah, it needs a cvs checkout, but it's really small. Will only take a couple of secs on a .5MBit connection
2005-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	aardvark		hwo do I do a reisnstall of Gnome ? on warty
2005-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	nealmcb	randabis	I pointed to http://higgs.djpig.de/ubuntu/www/  from a few ubuntu wiki pages
2005-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	lupusBE		can someone tell me if gnome-vfs depends on libgnome ?, gconf seems to be without it, but whatabout gnome-vfs?
2005-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	aardvark		anyone help me with reinstalling gnome ?
2005-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	all right then ... ;)
2005-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	that's probably not necessicary.
2005-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	what's the problem?
2005-02-24T01:36:00.000Z	randabis		mmk
2005-02-24T01:36:00.000Z	aardvark		I installed ATI drivers and know gnome is not working properly, I get login
2005-02-24T01:36:00.000Z	ultrahex		can someone help me with jpilot, i cant figure out what to put for "/dev/ttyUSB ..."
2005-02-24T01:36:00.000Z	aardvark		then just hangs for while and pops out back to login screen, did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2005-02-24T01:37:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	so you get to the graphical login screen?
2005-02-24T01:37:00.000Z	aardvark		yes, its like gnome is wacky
2005-02-24T01:38:00.000Z	GammaRay		can you try creating another user and logging in with it?
2005-02-24T01:38:00.000Z	delltony		dang how do you change the themes for xchat? i'm in small fugly mode :)
2005-02-24T01:38:00.000Z	aardvark		hmm let me try
2005-02-24T01:39:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	client/QueueManager.h:174: warning: taking address of temporary, scons: *** [build/client/ADLSearch.o]  Error 1, scons: building terminated because of errors., faile anyway
2005-02-24T01:39:00.000Z	tobbe		But you didn't get the time.h error?
2005-02-24T01:39:00.000Z	ultrahex		how would i list connected devices (such as USB and serial etc)
2005-02-24T01:39:00.000Z	bascule		lsusb
2005-02-24T01:40:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	FYI: go to the first VT, login, then enter: sudo adduser test1
2005-02-24T01:40:00.000Z	ultrahex	bascule	ok now how would i change bus and device # to a /dev/pilot
2005-02-24T01:41:00.000Z	bascule		no idea
2005-02-24T01:41:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	you should also check ~/.xsession-errors
2005-02-24T01:41:00.000Z	ultrahex		ugh ://///
2005-02-24T01:42:00.000Z	aardvark	GammaRay	you beut, beaut!, it must be a permissions issue, checking .xsession for my account
2005-02-24T01:43:00.000Z	Rocha		Hello
2005-02-24T01:43:00.000Z	arbeck		I'm having trouble trying to connect an external USB hard drive... I can see it when i do an fdisk -l and I have my /etc/fstab set up for it... but it won't mount
2005-02-24T01:43:00.000Z	GammaRay		one time .Xauthority was owned by root and that caused a similar problem for me
2005-02-24T01:44:00.000Z	Rocha		Do you know the name of the program to enable drop shadows in xorg, ?
2005-02-24T01:44:00.000Z	bascule		~/.Xauthority ~/.ICEauthority
2005-02-24T01:45:00.000Z	bascule	Rocha	xcompmgr, transset
2005-02-24T01:45:00.000Z	Rocha	bascule	thanks
2005-02-24T01:46:00.000Z	bascule	Rocha	it's buggy as hell and will probably freeze your desktop
2005-02-24T01:48:00.000Z	Rocha		btw, can i watch divx with totem-gstreamer?
2005-02-24T01:48:00.000Z	bascule		totem-xine
2005-02-24T01:48:00.000Z	Rocha	bascule	and dvd's ?
2005-02-24T01:48:00.000Z	bascule		needs win32codecs I think, or is there an open one for it now , I can't remeber
2005-02-24T01:49:00.000Z	Rocha		i can't download totem-xine (dialup connection)
2005-02-24T01:49:00.000Z	GammaRay		win32-codecs is much larger AFAIK
2005-02-24T01:49:00.000Z	bascule		dvd's work for me, I use xine, I haven't had a go at totem yet, I like xine, has always worked for me, that gstramer thing is new and strange to me :)
2005-02-24T01:50:00.000Z	Rocha		i hope gstreamer replaces xine soon
2005-02-24T01:50:00.000Z	lupusBE		gstreamer is still giving sync probs here
2005-02-24T01:50:00.000Z	bascule		I dont I hope its the other way .. :)
2005-02-24T01:50:00.000Z	lupusBE		with audio and video :(
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	Neil3		i have problems with gstreamer too
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	aardvark	GammaRay	it seems that there is a lot of weird issues now with gnome
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	bascule		kill esd and gstreamer bring in jackd and xine-libs for all
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	Neil3		try to avoid it if possible
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	GammaRay		dlocate says totem-xine is 2M and win32-codecs is 12M ( a little low to me)
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	AlphaXero		totem-xine doesnt come with the lidvdcss2 codec that it needs, besides, 12M seems a little high for a codec, not the other way around
2005-02-24T01:52:00.000Z	aardvark	GammaRay	how do I do a fresh install of gnome ?
2005-02-24T01:52:00.000Z	GammaRay	AlphaXero	it includes *many* codecs
2005-02-24T01:52:00.000Z	bascule	AlphaXero	not one codec lots, wmv wma in there too
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	AlphaXero		so why is totem-xine small is my point
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	arbeck		Can someone help me with mounting a usb hard drive?
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	Underlord		does ubuntu (non live) have any sort of firewall by default?
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	AlphaXero		i think 2M seems about right
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	bascule	Underlord	all Linux has a default firewall at the kernel level, apps are just front ends to that
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	the main settings files in your home dir are ~/.gnome2 ~/.gconfd
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	AlphaXero		i installed VLC and it works pretty well for dvd's, if anyone is still around that had that concern
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	ultrahex		man im having so much trouble getting palm to work with UBUNTU
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	AlphaXero		i know we were talking about it earlier
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	Neil3	AlphaXero	totem-xine is small cos it uses xinelib to do it's stuff
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	I would use mv so as to keep them just in case
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	Neil3		it's just a shell for it
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	Underlord		well i just tried to use a java applet in firefox that connects to 8801 of a server, and it failed, just wanted to know if it was on my end
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		hey
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	the reason you have to reinstall in windows is because windows usually does not seperate the settings.
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	Neil3		it really is that small :)
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	Rocha		bye, this dialup connection is expensive
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	SeanQ		Wow.
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	alumik		hi
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	SeanQ		It was THAT easy., I was about to go back to Fedora, but alas, it was all MY fault
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		where do the files that i "save to disk" go?
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	SeanQ		I put in "prism2_usb", was supposed to put in "wlan0"
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		it didn't give ma an option
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	SeanQ		when I put in wlan0, boom, i've got web, save to disk should go to../home/username, i think, question
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		seanq, are you having problems connecting to your internet?
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	SeanQ		i was, but i was so stupid, it was trivial, Question.
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	aardvark	GammaRay	so move the gconf files and then what ?
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	SeanQ		Where are my win32 files?
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	aardvark		restart gdm
2005-02-24T01:58:00.000Z	SeanQ		meaning my ntfs files
2005-02-24T01:58:00.000Z	GammaRay	aardvark	relogin

2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		when i download a file it won't let me open it, can anyone help?, it says "can't display location"

2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	arbeck	trashmatic	i've always found it easier to put the printer on linux and print to it from windows
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	cindux		get ready everyone for an extremely stupid ass question.., I'm from windows, never going back... I was just wondering before i create a folder on the desktop
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	trashmatic	arbeck	i'd like to be able to do that, but because of location and family politics, it's not happening
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	cindux		is their a DIR already on ubuntu, for "my files", "my documents", etc
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	trashmatic	arbeck	either i get it to print from linux, or this computer turns windows, unfortunately
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	wasabi_		So I'm looking for a good utility of some sort to get some sort of load graph for each of my HDs... suggestions?

2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	arbeck	cindux	i'd highly suggest getting a basic linux/unix book or printing out a guide... it's helpful and good to have around as a reference (espcially when you get stuck in vi)
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	cindux		Oo
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	trashmatic	cindux	there's a free book called "linux: rute user's tutorial and exposition"

2005-02-24T02:26:00.000Z	cindux		hm maybe ill check it out, is it free + shipping or something
2005-02-24T02:26:00.000Z	trashmatic	cindux	i think the text is free online as html or pdf

2005-02-24T02:29:00.000Z	s1amson		typing 'info' in a shell gives  good basic commands as well

2005-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	cindux		the command line makes me feel powerful :D
2005-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	s1amson		the command line _makes_ you powerful, its not a false feeling :] 
2005-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	bascule	cindux	that is because it is thee mostpowerful tool in modern cmputing, without equal in any way

2005-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	_|Immanewbie|_	s1amson	I have never heard about alinux virus at least in the windows concept (some program that infects you and you cant see it)
2005-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	Seq	Gul3	it could be a system process in the background (like updatedb or something). open a terminal, and run `top`
2005-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	s1amson		first written was a trojan, and i could be wrong.... but its atleast 5 years old, and actually comes with a 'disinfect' command for the end user

2005-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	Seq	Gul3	just "P" while top is running, and it will sort by processor usage
2005-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		do I have to add them to a special group
2005-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	s1amson	Gul3	try ps ux (for your user only) and 'ps aux' will list all
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	that gives me a fatal error :)
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	the funny thing is it works great on OSX and XP
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	bascule		not sounding too healthy, do you have front and rear usb ports? If so try the other way
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	Gul3		i'm not getting anyway.. i'm not too experienced linux user:/, i get a lot of output, but i don't know what i am looking after..
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	s1amson	Gul3	what are you trying to do?
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	Gul3		free up some cpu load
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	s1amson		ahh
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	I wonder if I can fix it in OSX or on an XP box
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	Seq	Gul3	there is a column labelled "%CPU". By typing "P" into top, you're sorting by that column. You can look down and find the process using the most cpu, and see what it is (under the "command" column)
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	and then try to mount it here
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	Gul3		it says 100% without any apps running
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	s1amson		think top is the only cmd line tool that will give you an active cup list, cpu*
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		hey, does ubuntu have telnet?
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	s1amson		could be wrong
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Gul3	you could paste the output of top to www.pastebin.ca, then post the link to the irc channel :)
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	I guess I have never used an extrernal drive, just thumbs
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		does ubuntu have linux?
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	bascule		???????
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	cindux		= /
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	_|Immanewbie|_		there is any way to "fix" my partition table?
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	cindux		lol
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	arbeck	bascule	well, I had an extra 30gb drive sitting around so i spent $15 on a case and made it into an external drive
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	cindux		it uses the linux kernel ;)
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	fsc	ubuntu2u	no. it's got windows
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	cindux		so ye
2005-02-24T02:42:00.000Z	fsc		it's the NT kernel underneath
2005-02-24T02:42:00.000Z	l3m		i want to start vsftpd but get 500 OOPS: could not bind to IPv4 socket.. any ideas?
2005-02-24T02:42:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	rightly so, I really dunno whats u with it
2005-02-24T02:42:00.000Z	bascule	arbeck	do you have an fstab entry for another usb device in there?
2005-02-24T02:42:00.000Z	Gul3		how can i get the output of top to a plain text file? can't get to the bottom line, lol
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		can i use telnet on ubuntu?
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	felix_1		Soryy .... Really need to know whay apache2 is unable to run php scripts: The module is loaded... but "User is not allowed to run scripts"-> from error.log need help!!!
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	bascule	Gul3	top -n 20 file.txt <-- that, cat file.txt | less
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	randabis	ubuntu2u	apt-get install telnetd I think
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	bascule		that ^ ?, telnet, shudder

2005-02-24T02:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	felix_1	and make them executable
2005-02-24T02:45:00.000Z	arbeck	cindux	just create a folder in your home directory
2005-02-24T02:45:00.000Z	bascule	Gul3	woops. command failure, lol
2005-02-24T02:45:00.000Z	cindux		er, i dont know hoe :(, if you mean the desktop, I'd rather not have it on their

2005-02-24T02:46:00.000Z	arbeck	cindux	cd ~ will take you to your home
2005-02-24T02:46:00.000Z	cindux		i know :P
2005-02-24T02:46:00.000Z	bestadvocate		sound juicer is broken
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	bascule	cindux	in firefox is that what you want to change?
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	cindux		?, I just want to create a DIR off the desktop to store .html files
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	bascule		edit download directories
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	felix_1	LinuxJones	you mean if apache 2 User and grp is "www-data" then chown php-exec to this ?
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	cindux		if I place it in /home it wont show on my desktop right ?
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	bascule		mkdir ~/web
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	felix_1	I don't run apache or php but it sounds like you need to make your php scripts executable and change ownsership
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	cindux	bascule	where would that place it ?
2005-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	bascule		no /home/Desktop goes on the dektop
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	felix_1	yeah
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	cindux		/home/cindux
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	bascule		~/web would be /home/cindux/web
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	cindux		is cindux a dir ?
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	bascule		depends on your user name ( are you taking the piss?)
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	cindux		oh icicic, lol
2005-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	felix_1	but I'm not sure 100% sure on that what does that error.log file say ?
2005-02-24T02:49:00.000Z	bascule		:)))
2005-02-24T02:49:00.000Z	trashmatic		okay, this is really troubling. i'm trying to configure cups myself, but ubuntu has disabled the web interface!? "for my protection", i'm sure, but i want to turn it on, thanks
2005-02-24T02:49:00.000Z	felix_1	LinuxJones	no- you are not correct, php script files no need to be exec ... apache cannot run the script. php module is loaded but intuitively, I suspect a misconf in the apache or/and php rights
2005-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	trashmatic		because the print config app doesnt work, or at least isnt adequately documented :/
2005-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	cindux		hm, if im in a different dir in the term does it matter, or do i have to be in /home/cindux when i do mkdir ~/web
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	bascule		no ~ will expand to /home/cindux
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	cindux		:(, to much lol
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	bascule		or /home/<whoever>/
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		does anyoen here know how to hack?
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	bascule	ubuntu2u	shut up
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	cindux		ubuntu theirs really no such thing as hacking, all hacking is is knowing certain holes & flaws & exposing them
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	bascule	shut up you have a small penis
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	cindux		=/
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	_|Immanewbie|_		my partition magic says error 117. Ive google and found no solution =/
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		we all know so stop hiding it
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	trashmatic		the ~ is really quite cool, but you could always type /home/username if you rather, no harm ;)
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	bascule		I haven;t, but I suspect you said that for a reaon
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	felix_1	like I said I don't know just offering sugggestion
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		yes
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	cindux		ah, ?, mkdir ~web /home/cindux ?
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		because i was watching you change last night when a popup came onto my computer for dad's and kids going at it and i thought to myself.... hmmm thaat kid has a small penis, so i quickly exited
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	trashmatic		no, you'd use 'mkdir /home/cindux/web', that means the same as 'mkdir ~/web'
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	cindux		ah, and to be sure... lol :(
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	SeanQ	ubuntu2u	NAMBLA at work

2005-02-24T03:01:00.000Z	mebaran151		and how does vsftpd differentiate between local and remote users
2005-02-24T03:01:00.000Z	inc	bascule	i reverted back to warty and back to playing cds lol better than before
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	bob2	trashmatic	why?
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	bascule	inc	good idea, it wasl ooking complicated to fix
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	cindux		how do i remove a file ?
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	fallker		hey all
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	cindux		rem ?, rm ?
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	bascule		rm -f file
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	trashmatic	bob2	ubuntu apparently patched it to completely remove the web interface, which i want to use because gnome-cups-manager sucks
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	fallker		rm
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	Seazzy		hey, I need direction
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	ryan_		whats the key combo to kill an app ?
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	cindux		ah
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	s1amson		www.mapquest.com
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	fallker	ryan_	what kind of app?
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	ryan_		xmms is hanging
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	inc	bascule	well maybe i have a better change now.. i think i'm at the point where i need to configure the mixer..i typed alsamixer and unmuted pcm
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	bascule	ryan_	alt f4 closes one, xkill gives a magic cursor pkill appname is another way, there are lots ..
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	s1amson	ryan_	hanging when you load a directory?
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	Seazzy		I have just installed warty/X86, and my celeron box is freezing on me. Anyone know what's up?
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	inc		i already did the modprobe stuff and that went well
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	ryan_		no, it was playing. but now it just hanged after finishing a song
2005-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	s1amson		perhaps it tried to play an invalid mp3?
2005-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		just xkill it, the magic cursor will do fine, eventually Gnome will ask you if you want to kill it I think
2005-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	ryan_		xkill-ed
2005-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		cool
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	s1amson		xmms is virtually bug free, any error you get with it is normally via something you tried to feed it
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	ryan_		gonna add that kill button to the panel
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	Seazzy		Does anyone know what log I should be checking for specific error msgs regarding the unfortunate freezing of ubuntu?
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	SeanQ		No clue.
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	cindux		system logs :D, lol, i dont know anything dont listen to me, but /etc as far as i know has ubuntus system logs
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	bestadvocate		whens the stable release for hoary due?
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	bascule		/var/log/messages, but you rarely find much after a crash to be fair
2005-02-24T03:08:00.000Z	zeratha		I am trying to get Ubuntu set up on a friend's computer and I keep having problems with sound. I've tried everything recommended in the forums and wiki, so I'm stumped.
2005-02-24T03:09:00.000Z	Seazzy		hmmn, anyone here who has had a simmilar problem?, to the freezing, not the sound
2005-02-24T03:09:00.000Z	scoon	zeratha	what kind of sound hw ?
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		ubuntu hasn't detected my cdrom drive, there is no /dev/hdc.. any ideas?
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	zeratha		Audigy. All the right drivers seem loaded, and XMMS plays as though the sound card were fine with Alsa, OSS, and ESD, but no sound. Real Player says the sound device is in use and the gnome-volume applet say no device found.
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	membreya		hiyas
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		hi
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	felix_1	LinuxJones	ok sorry for my late reply : you were telling that you only wianted to give me suggestions ... :-0 thanx for that ... I partially fixed my problem: module suphp was installed and seems to screwup php execution... but I get full load of php scrit errors related or not to configurations... anyway... sorry :-)
2005-02-24T03:11:00.000Z	scoon		zerath, is there onboard sound chips ?
2005-02-24T03:11:00.000Z	zeratha		Yes, disabled in the BIOS
2005-02-24T03:11:00.000Z	membreya		got a problem trying to execute a configure script..getting the following two error messages, checking for working makeinfo... missing, checking for XML::Parser... configure: error: XML::Parser perl module is required for intltool, any ideas? :(
2005-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	zeratha		Oh, and all cables are connected properly. Got sound when I installed, but since updating, its gone.
2005-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	scoon	zeratha	updated to hoary ?
2005-02-24T03:14:00.000Z	mebaran151		how can I tell what daemons are running at any one moment?, just daemons
2005-02-24T03:14:00.000Z	membreya		ps --help, :| nvm ;)
2005-02-24T03:15:00.000Z	zeratha	scoon	no, just standard updates. It's the weirdest thing. No problem on any other machine but this one.
2005-02-24T03:17:00.000Z	scoon	zeratha	check alsamixer and make certain that 'Audigy Analog/Digital Output Jack' is NOT muted
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	zeratha	scoon	Thanks! That was it!
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	scoon	zeratha	
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	fsc		hmm..gpd is fubar on warty. i really need to upgrade gnome/gkt+ and all development libraries without going all the way to hoary
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	scoon	zeratha	in order for that to not get muted again when you reboot or log out whatever
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	scoon	zeratha	do a, 'sudo alsactl store' in a term
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	fsc		lack of decent gtk/gnome pdf viewer is annoying
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	jdub	fsc	using hoary?
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	zeratha	scoon	thanks, I need to log out to see if the applet works. Thanks again.
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	scoon		np
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	membreya		so anyone know why I'm getting checking for XML::Parser... configure: error: XML::Parser perl module is required for intltool ? when I'm trying to configure?
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	jdub	fsc	try gpdf, but then try evince :-)
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	jdub	membreya	look at intltool's depends
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	i want to upgrade to 2.9.3 of gpdf, but i'm on warty and i need all the 2.6 gtk stuff
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	jdub	fsc	upgrade to hoary :)
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	gpdf is not rendering properly
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	xpdf is well...lackluster at best
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	jdub		it's not that much better in later versions, evince is
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	envince i should try?
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	membreya		thanks for that jdub ... I did an apt-get -f install :)
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	fsc		never heard of envince, me looks
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	jdub	fsc	evince, it'll be in GNOME 2.12
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	: cool. evince looks nice. thanks for info man
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	and ps viewer integrated. me like
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	jdub	fsc	it's designed to be a 'document viewer', so integrates a few of the existing gnome apps nicely
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	is this your project? didn't you have something to do with gpdf?
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	jdub		no, to both, apart from being involved in gnome generally
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	fsc		ok, always see your name in gpdf changelog for some reason, well the gpdf site hasn't been updated in eons
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	jdub		i think martin thanked me once
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	fsc		but i definitely want to check out evince...on its web site now
2005-02-24T03:25:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	i wonder what it'll take to get this thing running on warty.  i see packages for hoary.  i don't want to pooch-screw my system just for a pdf viewer
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	cindux		whats the absolute path to the desktop ?
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	fsc		i'll build it from source if it doesn't rely on gtk+ 2.6 and gnome 2.8
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	membreya		grrrr damn hoary live cd giving me false hope...it got my wireless nic working without a problem...
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	membreya	cindux	/usr/home/(username)/Desktop, -usr, so it's just /home/(username)/Desktop
2005-02-24T03:28:00.000Z	cindux		hm icic, and just wonderin, I want to remove a DIR & all its contents?, can i just do rm /home/desktop/cindux/web
2005-02-24T03:28:00.000Z	membreya		do an rm -f -R, make sure u do it as sudo
2005-02-24T03:29:00.000Z	cindux		"rm -f -r /home/cindux/web ?, with sudo in front *
2005-02-24T03:29:00.000Z	jdub	cindux	not if you own the files
2005-02-24T03:29:00.000Z	u		Hello, can anyone help me a sec with a mount ntfs problem?
2005-02-24T03:31:00.000Z	s1amson		i can try, :] 
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	u		ok slamson
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	cindux		hm seems like so much....
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	u		thank you
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	s1amson		dont thank me yet, i havent helped
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	u		lol, ok
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	cindux		"/home/cindux/desktop/files", to much :(
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	u		i want to auto mount a ntfs drive
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	s1amson		ok..., that it?
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	u		lol, yes
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	s1amson		look at (do a search for) fstab
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	u		i have a harder question coming up after this one
2005-02-24T03:34:00.000Z	s1amson		and edit it, :D
2005-02-24T03:34:00.000Z	u		lol, "edit it" care to elaborate :p
2005-02-24T03:35:00.000Z	cindux		this cant be it
2005-02-24T03:35:00.000Z	s1amson		give it the same rights as any other partition, note: that if you see one with -rw - change it to -ro as you cant write to ntfs, actually, find fstab, and paste what it says @ pastebin.com
2005-02-24T03:36:00.000Z	cindux		Surely theirs a dir i can use to store my files instead of /home/cindux/dirname
2005-02-24T03:36:00.000Z	s1amson		no, theresnot much to elaborate on
2005-02-24T03:36:00.000Z	cindux		where does everyone store their files, html files,movies music etc
2005-02-24T03:36:00.000Z	u		im having trouble finding fstab
2005-02-24T03:36:00.000Z	s1amson		but, considering its ntfs, it wouldnt hurt to have a look see at your current config
2005-02-24T03:36:00.000Z	u		please note: im fresh from migration
2005-02-24T03:37:00.000Z	s1amson		please note: i dont use ubuntu :P but its a linux thing not ubuntu
2005-02-24T03:37:00.000Z	u		lol ok
2005-02-24T03:37:00.000Z	s1amson		lemme find mine

2005-02-24T03:39:00.000Z	u		im jus gonna do a new login as root
2005-02-24T03:39:00.000Z	s1amson		or... somkething
2005-02-24T03:39:00.000Z	membreya		gah
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	s1amson		yea, you need to be root to edit it
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	membreya		what's the easiest way to find the file that a make install has created? :P
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	s1amson		pin <filename>, well... easiest way for me anyway
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	membreya		erm that's the thing... I can't find the name that it gave it ..I think I can but searching the harddrive shows nothing
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	cindux		spit it out :P
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	s1amson		::shrugs ::
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	cindux		you know you all want to
2005-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	u		/dev/hdc1   /   ntfs    |then what?       1, slamson, i what user "glen" to be the owner
2005-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	s1amson		how are we spossa help find a file that nobody knows the name of :P be smarter about it nxt time :D
2005-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	membreya		;), bash: pin: command not found
2005-02-24T03:42:00.000Z	tobbe		Can I install stuff with apt-get from debian repositories?
2005-02-24T03:44:00.000Z	cindux		Where does everyone store their files? (text,audio,video etc)
2005-02-24T03:45:00.000Z	s1amson	u	mounting yourself, id mount it to /mnt/hdc1 so, in '/mnt' make a folder called windows and give it your permissions (whatever they may be) then just run as root mount /mnt/hdc1 /mnt/windows since toy, ack, i edited that line alot :\, make a folder in mnt as root, and give glen permmissions - ie: make owner etc, id call the folder windows, :: shrugs ::
2005-02-24T03:46:00.000Z	tobbe	cindux	I store my text/docs in /home/tobbe/documents and for audio/video I've go an external harddrive
2005-02-24T03:46:00.000Z	s1amson		then, mount /mnt/hdc1 /mnt/windows, should work fine
2005-02-24T03:46:00.000Z	cindux		hm i was afraid of this lol, i know it isnt a big deal but i like to keep things neat & brief, for example, on windows I would have C:\Cinder, jus dont like how I have to dig through so many dirs to my files, anyway thanks
2005-02-24T03:47:00.000Z	s1amson		i dont have any ntfs partitions, but heres mine for fat32 (in fstab), /dev/hda1            /windows/C           vfat       users,gid=users,umask=0002,iocharset=utf8 0 0
2005-02-24T03:47:00.000Z	u		slamson, ok cheerz mate ill try that
2005-02-24T03:47:00.000Z	tobbe		And on linux you have /home/cinder/ It's only one level deeper
2005-02-24T03:47:00.000Z	cindux		i know :(
2005-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	s1amson		check mount --help for mount options
2005-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	cindux		but i wanted the folder on my desktop, /home/cindux/desktop/documents/html, lol
2005-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	s1amson		and put those in the last part of the fstab
2005-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	u		ok
2005-02-24T03:49:00.000Z	cindux		mkdir ~files /home/cindux, oops
2005-02-24T03:49:00.000Z	inc		anyone know how to make sure alsa and esd are configured correctly?
2005-02-24T03:49:00.000Z	tobbe	cindux	just put the stuff in /home/cindux/whatever and then put symlinks in the desktop folder
2005-02-24T03:51:00.000Z	cindux		hm sounds better, when i use mkdir ~whatever, does it automatically assume im creating the dir in /home/cindux/, or must I specify it
2005-02-24T03:52:00.000Z	s1amson		oh ship, hey, u
2005-02-24T03:52:00.000Z	klimbz		I know you guys are probably sick pf hearing this, but can someone please help me out in getting the grub entry right for setting up windows ,(installed on c:, with ubuntu on secondary hardrive..
2005-02-24T03:53:00.000Z	pepsi		where would i look to learn how to make mp3s work/, oop, found it
2005-02-24T03:53:00.000Z	klimbz		my current entry is: title Windows, map (hd0)(hd1), map (hd1)(hd0), rootnoverify (hd0,0), chainloader +1, makeactive
2005-02-24T03:54:00.000Z	tobbe	cindux	I dunno, just try..., won't break anything, you won't be able to create it anywhere else if you're not root
2005-02-24T03:55:00.000Z	klimbz		anyone?, anyone with a link to where I can get a full menu.lst grub entry for dual booting windows, ?
2005-02-24T04:00:00.000Z	membreya	klimbz	http://www.ubuntuguide.org/
2005-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	tobbe		This is what I've got for windows: title           Windows NT/2000/XP, root            (hd0,1), savedefault, makeactive, chainloader     +1, it's on /dev/hda2
2005-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	klimbz		I've got my xp in c: would that be hda0 or 1?
2005-02-24T04:03:00.000Z	membreya		it counts from 0 klimbz, so if C: is your first physical drive & partition then it's 0,0
2005-02-24T04:04:00.000Z	klimbz	membreya	so what would my full entry in menu.lst be? sorry to ask these trivial questions but I'm completely new at this..
2005-02-24T04:04:00.000Z	cindux		ugg i was away when people rplied, How can i remove a directory? & how can I create one in /home/cindux/dirname ?
2005-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	tobbe		remove: rm, create: mkdir
2005-02-24T04:06:00.000Z	s1amson		rm -rf /pathto<directory to be removed> note, there will be no chance of recovery
2005-02-24T04:06:00.000Z	membreya		root, savedefault, makeactive, chainloader
2005-02-24T04:08:00.000Z	cindux		er.., i tried before and made a mistake, and now i have -documents, or think ido ?, is that their by default in ubuntu
2005-02-24T04:08:00.000Z	tobbe		so, rm -fdR /home/cindux/-documents/
2005-02-24T04:09:00.000Z	cindux	tobbe	its still their

2005-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	cindux		i just found it odd that when i screwed up the command the first time, it said no dir exist, but created -documents anyway
2005-02-24T04:14:00.000Z	tobbe		it didn't create -documents, it created ~documents (or you have done earlier)

2005-02-24T04:25:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		just every file that i have downloaded off the internet, like merc, or ad-aware install
2005-02-24T04:25:00.000Z	mpq		you mean a bunch of windows programs?
2005-02-24T04:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	those are windows programs aren't they
2005-02-24T04:26:00.000Z	tezza	ubuntu2u	do some research on wine
2005-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	moyogo		ad-aware? i don't think you'd need that on ubuntu
2005-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	mpq		I was wondering that too, I don't think any malicious programs would work outside of windows, because they're all windows programs
2005-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	moyogo		one day, it might be a threat tho'
2005-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	mpq		maybe, but not now
2005-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	moyogo		in a far far away galaxy
2005-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	mpq		not while 99% of people use windows
2005-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	cindux		im in love with ubuntu
2005-02-24T04:29:00.000Z	mpq		anyone else here running folding@home?
2005-02-24T04:29:00.000Z	SeanQ		not 99%, 95%, 3% apple, 2% linux
2005-02-24T04:29:00.000Z	mpq		really? that much?
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	giard		does anyone know if Hoary will have a selection of backgrounds?
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	mpq		I didn't think mac was quite that popular
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	Pinguvin		when will hoary be released?
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	moyogo	giard	there's a monthly background
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	daniels	Pinguvin	april

2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	Pinguvin		whats wrong with naked people? :P
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	membreya	giard	what's the point of that?
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		linuxjones, yes those are windows programs that i am trying to run
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	LinuxJones	membreya	you probably need to install build-essential
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	daniels	SeanQ	according to hp, linux is now more popular than mac
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	mpq		you need wine to run windows programs in linux
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	yeah
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	moyogo	giard	just right-click on pictures in firefox and set as background
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	daniels		on the desktop
2005-02-24T04:32:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		linuxjones, can't they still be used?
2005-02-24T04:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	you don't need ad-aware or whatever it is
2005-02-24T04:32:00.000Z	giard	moyogo	I kinda wish there was a selection of good quality wallpapers, just like XP and OS X come with

2005-02-24T04:33:00.000Z	moyogo	giard	i find the monthly wallpapers to be of pretty good quality, unfortunately some find the nude art offensive
2005-02-24T04:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	you can't run any windows applications on Linux easily
2005-02-24T04:34:00.000Z	gaatmx		Sorry if this is a FAQ but: Is there a way to add an application to the Menu?
2005-02-24T04:34:00.000Z	Pinguvin		right click and add locator or something like that
2005-02-24T04:34:00.000Z	mpq		yes, that's why you get the equivalent programs for most apps
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		linuxjones, i don't think it is the files... i think there is something else messed up
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	bc		right click in Firefox doesn't give me any options for wallpaper in ubuntu
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		i'll tell you the errormessage
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	membreya		I'm trying to add an applet..and slowly going crazy
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	mpq		anyone know of a program that would cycle through wallpapers?
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	bc		actually I can't understand why it's so hard to set background pictures.
2005-02-24T04:35:00.000Z	Pinguvin		its not hard..?
2005-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	moyogo	bc	it does in hoary
2005-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	bc		should be able to right click on any image, but no, have to use the "change desktop background" thing and do a lot of browsing
2005-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		linuxjones, the title of the window is "can't display location" and then then it says couldn't display home/liam/****(**** is the file name) then under that it says "there was an error launching the application"
2005-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	GammaRay		one thing I never did in IE was set the background
2005-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		if anyone else know the problem please help
2005-02-24T04:36:00.000Z	Pinguvin		<bc> you got a point there
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	GammaRay	bc	you can drage it to the dialog AFAIK
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	mpq		I mean like automatically change the wallpaper every day or something
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	moyogo	gaatmx	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/OldFrequentlyAskedQuestions#head-17eca0f11b06e5e4489700e0d0ce4e3f5a07090e-2

2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	bc		yes, but there's seems to be a very short limit to the number of images allowed in there
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		can anyone help me?, plz
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	bc		drag something in, something else leaves
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	Pinguvin	ubuntu2u	whats the files extension
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	bc		wish the image viewer had a "set as background" option at least
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	moyogo	ubuntu2u	what exactly are you trying to run?
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	programs that run on Microsoft products (like Windows 95, 98 2000, XP) will not run in Linux.
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	moyogo	bc	some image viewers do
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	moyogo	bc	gthumb does for example
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	membreya		anyone know an EASY way (short of programming) to get an applet into the gnome panel???
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	bc		yes, I imagine I just have to stop being lazy and check the repositories., but I'm surprised gnome doesn't just build this in, thanksd moyogo!
2005-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	membreya		noone here plays around with applets? :(
2005-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	moyogo	i am trying to run anything... is there a linux website that i can go to download linux stuff to try it?
2005-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	bc		weird, Synaptic tells me I have gtthumb installed, but I don't know where the heck it is
2005-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	moyogo	membreya	do you mean progamming applets?
2005-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	lunitik	membreya	not entirely sure what you mean? right click "add to panel"?
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	Pinguvin	bc	run application > gthumb
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	mpq	ubuntu2u	try downloading firefox 1.0
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	bc		really noob here, is gtthumb simply what's showing me the (really  great) thumbnails in Nautilus?
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	mpq		and make sure to get the linux version, it should be a .tar.gz file
2005-02-24T04:44:00.000Z	poisomike87		hello
2005-02-24T04:44:00.000Z	membreya	lunitik	that only allows you to create a launcher.. I have an embedded program to control the stepping on my athlon 64 however there's no .server file to embed it in the panel
2005-02-24T04:44:00.000Z	moyogo	bc	you need to refresh the panel, i haven't figured out how to do that cleanly, sometimes it does it by itself
2005-02-24T04:44:00.000Z	poisomike87		I have a problem
2005-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	lunitik	membreya	then my guess is the person that wrote it will have to make it a functional applet  :/
2005-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	tell us what kind of programs you want to run we can tell you what "Linux Versions" or Windows programs to install if they exist :)
2005-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	mpq	poisomike87	just ask it
2005-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	lunitik	poisomike87	you going to share, or are we to guess?
2005-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	membreya		thanks anyway lunitik...will email the guy
2005-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	moyogo	lunitik	what's the name of the program?
2005-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	lunitik	moyogo	huh?
2005-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	poisomike87		When I installed ubunto when it finished i cannot boot it or windows
2005-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	moyogo	lunitik	sorry i meant membreya
2005-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	bc		thanks Pinguvin!  and of course, now that you guys mention it, I finally notice it in the apps menu...
2005-02-24T04:46:00.000Z	Pinguvin		:)
2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	fsc		hmm. has anybody just upgraded gnome from the hoary repository?
2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	what issue are you seeing?
2005-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	Pinguvin		i just installed ubuntu but i cant get any sound. how can this be fixed?
2005-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	i haven't tried it, but these programs i want to compile, specifically evince needs gtk+2.6 and other more recent gnome libraries
2005-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	i'd rather just update gnome,gtk+ all its dependencies then a mass upgrade to Hoary, especially xorg
2005-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	I am using it... no obvious issues...
2005-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	hoary?  what did you do, just change the repository name, apt-get update, and then apt-get dist-upgrade?
2005-02-24T04:49:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	why not xorg?
2005-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	what about ATI drivers on xorg?
2005-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	yup... a few times... most recently just grabbed a daily snapshot...
2005-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	fsc		a few times what?
2005-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	hmm... I thought daniels had released ATI drivers for xorg?
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	i have no idea who daniels is
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	a few times did a manual upgrade to hoary.
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	oh, on various boxes then?
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	poisomike87		I cannot boot ubunto or windows grub just gives me an error 18 message
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	daniels = Daniel Stone of freedesktop and main Ubuntu X maintainer...
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	uhmm. so it was just that easy for you?  what about the kernel, does hoary want to change the kernel?
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	so change the repository, dist-upgrade, reboot, and everything was hunky-dory?
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	sasquatc4		i hate you s1amson
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	depends if you have 'linux-386' etc installed... 2.6.10 is in hoary though...
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	sasquatc4		anyone got experience in here with an audigyLS card?
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	should be, yes.
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	s1amson		but i love your mother
2005-02-24T04:52:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		linuxjones, i thought linux was so compatible with windows programs you could run practiacally anything on here...?
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	hmm. i'm scared...Warty is so perfect right now except for pdf viewer crap
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntu2u	you can run some Windows apps with 'wine' ...
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	so what's special about Hoary?
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	vj		hi guys, someone to help me put links to applications
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	that issue will remain (crappy xpdf instead of evince/gpdf) ... but you really won't see any issues.
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	very little... hence very few problems  :)
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	no, to run Microsoft programs you need software and permission from Microsoft which they won't give to the Open Source Community
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	poisomike87		Anyone know how to fix the grub boot loader to boot all I get is an error 18 message
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	with an upgrade to Hoary Gnome I would have the libs to build or even dpkg -i evince
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	lunitik	LinuxJones	you technically don't need Microsoft permission...
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lunitik	yeah wanna bet
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	vj		help pls, anyone somewhere
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	probably yes...

2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	lunitik	LinuxJones	I have Internet Explorer here for testing purposes... call Microsoft and see if they care...
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	moyogo	vj	what's the problem you have?
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	bahh. screw it. i have nothing better to do

2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	nothing will get screwed up.
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lunitik	tell them you are running Office 2000 on 10 machines using wine and see what they say.
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	vj		i loaded some application from synaptics but they don't so up in the program menus
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	ok, where are the repositories at?

2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		so linux isn't good for playing games or anything like that?
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	Pinguvin	vj	they might if you log out and back in
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	lunitik	LinuxJones	actually... I did that for 30... they helped, but ended up stating "well, the issue isn't with our applications, sorry"...
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	vj		i did
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	Pinguvin		oh
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	Gul3		hello, probably just another newbie question from me, but how do i execute "format c:" in linux?

2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	inc		so anyone good at configuring alsa/
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	it depends on the company that makes the games.
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	vj		they show up in the filesystem and i can run them from there, but can't see any icon in the apllication drop down list
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	moyogo	vj	what application was it?
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	Pinguvin	vj	if you right click inside the menu, do you get add launcher?
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	Dull404	Gul3	use fdisk... if there is fdisk.. dont know just installed myself ;)
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	vj		there are many
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lunitik	that's not true
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	lunitik	LinuxJones	you purchase a license to run the software... you don't break the eula by not running it on Microsoft software.
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	Gul3	Dull404	that will not format the partition
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	moyogo	lunitik	most of the times those games are built on top of Microsoft libraries
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	moyogo	lunitik	and those aren't free
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	vj		grisp an accounting package, atank game, Sykpe, qtparted, firestarter.
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	Dull404	Gul3	delete the partition, and create it again ;)
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	lunitik	LinuxJones	You think Codeweavers would base a business model on having people break the law?
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	Pinguvin	vj	right click inside a menu > entire menu > create launcher
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	Krypt0n		Who uses X-Chat and has a good script to show what MP3 is playing?
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	Pinguvin		or add a launcher.., add new item to this menu actually :)

2005-02-24T05:00:00.000Z	Pinguvin	lunitik	says it wont work in the future..
2005-02-24T05:00:00.000Z	regeya_		seriously?  one won't be able to add launchers to gnome menus?, dang.  and just when I thought it was safe to use gnome.
2005-02-24T05:00:00.000Z	moyogo	Pinguvin	adding a program to the Application menu doesn't work right now in hoary
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	regeya_		oh, just a hoary issue?
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	lunitik	Pinguvin	that mechanism changed in hoary... right now, there is no menu editing tool at all in hoary.
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	cindux		:P
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	moyogo	regeya_	you'll always be able to add to the panel

2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	lunitik	moyogo	via the text files... sure.
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	moyogo		it's still feasable throught applications;//
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	regeya_	moyogo	not good enough, but thanks for reminding me of that
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	cindux		"/usr/share/backgrounds?" ?
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	lunitik	moyogo	no... applications:/// doesn't exist
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	moyogo	lunitik	ahhhhh!

2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	ok. i changed the repository to hoary.  here goes nothing.  i'll be hunting down lunitik (can I trust that nick:)? if something goes wrong:)
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	lunitik	what did you think of that link I posted ?
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	Pinguvin	vj	try grisbi..

2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	poisomike87		I installed ubunto on a dual boot with windows now i can no longer boot windows or ubunto
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	linux_galore		think LinuxJones is trying to get karma points
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	your name is in it :D
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	linux_galore		:-)

2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	fsc		485 meg for the upgrade to hoary for me.  nice speeds though.  300 kB/s
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_galore	browny-points  +1 :D
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	Pinguvin		i got a major audio problem. cant get any sound.. help please
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	Dull404	poisomike87	grub right?
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	poisomike87		yes
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	bc		anyone elso have problems with audigy nx usb2 sound hardware?  both ubuntu and mepis seem to identify the thing right,
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	Pinguvin		"sorry, no mixer elements and/or devices fond"
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	Dull404	poisomike87	im new to ubuntu myself. but for other distros u can edit it manually, try search the web for a grub howto for ubuntu
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	fsc		please tell me that wxWidgets got upgraded in Hoary to use gtk2+ finally
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	bc		but both produce horrible distorted sound, could the problem be the usb2?, oh, and the mixer thinks the audigy is outputting to headphones... weird
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	lunitik	fsc	'libwxgtk2.5.3' depends gtk-2.0... so looks like it...
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	moyogo	poisomike87	does this relate to your problem : http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/WartyWarthogInstallNotes ?
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	yeah thats because USB headsets in call centers are common
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	good deal.
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	vj		well i cannot load the application from grisbi

2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	bc		do I need some special soundblaster driver or something?
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	membreya		grrrrrrrrrrrrrr,,,why can't I find the ndiswrapper?
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	could be I went to the creative website and downloaded the latest driver
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	membreya		nevermind ;) ndiswrapper.sf.net
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	vj	moyogo	? pingiun ?
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	bc		hmm, I'll look again.  I didn't think creative "supported" linux

2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	they do and have for a while now
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	bc		thanks
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	inc		anybody good with alsa? or sound?
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Pinguvin		i dont have sound at all.. :(
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	bc		I just wish that when I get the right mixer, I could get decent sound
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Dull404		Bc: got alsa tools?
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	bc		when I get good sound, I get a senseless mixer
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	vj		ok i got it
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Pinguvin		great :)
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	moyogo	vj	what was the problem?
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	bc		hmmm, an alsa mixer shows up along the other one, but don't know about the tools...
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	vj		any command has to follow with ( application ) %f
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	linux_galore		I usually just grab a SB Live OEM card cost me AU$20 works perfect with any distro of Linux
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	vj		and it works, now the only problem is where to get the icons from for that appplication
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	s1amson		anyone got experience in here with an audigyLS card?
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	bc		that's the painful irony, i recently took out my SB live card, to use the usb2 thing, guess I'll put it back in
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	the other card works better lol
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	membreya		has anyone here used ndiswrapper on ubuntu?
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	s1amson	bc	
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	Pinguvin		how do i install alsamixer? when i try to open it it says: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: no such device
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	vj		where are the applications that are loaded store their icons in
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	s1amson		you know anything about audigy LS card?
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	I get perfect 5.1 suround from my SBLive card
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	s1amson		sry
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	sasquatc4		sinner
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	s1amson		just like mom! :D
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	Dull404	Pinguvin	use Synaptic Package Manager. and also do "whereis alsa" in a terminal
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	linux_galore	Pinguvin	alsa mixer wont work if sound isnt up and running
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	s1amson		dont make me use bold!
2005-02-24T05:16:00.000Z	Pinguvin		okey.. how do i get it up and running then :\
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	Pinguvin	alsamixer isnt a sound setup tool it just adjusts the volume settings
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	Pinguvin		i see
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	s1amson		anyone got experience in here with an audigy LS card?
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	bc		I've never been able to get a sound card working in any computer ever without a lot of grief, sound cards are evil and hate me.
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	inc		nope
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	inc	bc	you are correct sir
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	just worked here didnt do a thing
2005-02-24T05:17:00.000Z	Pinguvin		audio worked in suse, mandrake and vida.. but not here, i dont know what to do
2005-02-24T05:18:00.000Z	bc		are alsa tools the same as alsa-utils (which I seem to have installed)
2005-02-24T05:18:00.000Z	s1amson		alsa yhassnt helped my issue
2005-02-24T05:18:00.000Z	Dull404	bc	i think so
2005-02-24T05:18:00.000Z	s1amson		i got everyting working but the linein
2005-02-24T05:19:00.000Z	Pinguvin		what is alsa yhassnt?
2005-02-24T05:19:00.000Z	linux_galore		many people have the cards setup wrong I find ie they have auto IRQ set on the jumpers on the card and that can create a IRQ conflict with Linux/Windows
2005-02-24T05:19:00.000Z	s1amson		its the one for the leet users that pwn a decoder ring, thx for asking
2005-02-24T05:19:00.000Z	bc		to be fair, On my laptop, the sound is great.  Don't even know what card it is.
2005-02-24T05:19:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	what kind of machine do you have?
2005-02-24T05:20:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	packard bell g1320
2005-02-24T05:20:00.000Z	tritium		a lot of people that don't get sound have Parallel Port interrup collisions
2005-02-24T05:20:00.000Z	linux_galore		Im finding all the new intel sound chipsets work fine lately
2005-02-24T05:20:00.000Z	inc		yeah well how about crystal audio?
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	my parallel ports are not used
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	bc		this is my untested, incompetent theory about usb2 audio in linux:  somehow data's going through as if it were usb1
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	okay.  You disabled them?
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	bc		and thus distorting
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	Pinguvin		no.. i mean.. i never use them :p
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	Im finding USB audio in Linux is one of those things that needs work
2005-02-24T05:21:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	yes, but is the "lp" module loaded?
2005-02-24T05:22:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	i have no idea..?
2005-02-24T05:22:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	"lsmod | grep lp"
2005-02-24T05:22:00.000Z	bc	linux_galore	that's a relief to hear.  ok, no more farting around, back in goes the Live value card
2005-02-24T05:23:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	the parport says: 2 parport_pc, lp
2005-02-24T05:23:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	yes, then your parallel port IS being used.
2005-02-24T05:23:00.000Z	tweek888		anyone know how to get flash working =\
2005-02-24T05:23:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	any idea how i turn it off?
2005-02-24T05:23:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	you can often disable in BIOS
2005-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	I use USB audio only for VoIP and in that case sound quality doesnt matter much its mono with a 200-1200hz range
2005-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	or, you can boot with kernel option "acpi_irq_isa=7"
2005-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	thundrcleeze	tweek888	sudo apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla, that and other facts are available at www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	ok.. i'll try the boot option then
2005-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	tweek888		thanks
2005-02-24T05:25:00.000Z	thundrcleeze		np
2005-02-24T05:25:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	okay, that doesn't disable the parallel port, but it might solve your sound problem.  No guarantees, though.
2005-02-24T05:25:00.000Z	linux_galore		Ive got shockwave and quicktime working with mozilla/firefox
2005-02-24T05:26:00.000Z	Pinguvin		tritiun: booting up now :)
2005-02-24T05:26:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		tritium! your back old chap
2005-02-24T05:26:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntu2u	hey there
2005-02-24T05:26:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntu2u	I'm putting ubuntu on my other machine today., I killed Sid!, Sid won't be bothering my toys anymore.
2005-02-24T05:27:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	whats the USB sound device in question
2005-02-24T05:27:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	i still cant turn the volume on
2005-02-24T05:28:00.000Z	bc		SB Audigy nx external usb2
2005-02-24T05:28:00.000Z	linux_galore		Ive got Ubunti on my Apple sMac_top
2005-02-24T05:28:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	oh.  Are your sound modules loaded?
2005-02-24T05:28:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	whats the command?
2005-02-24T05:29:00.000Z	linux_galore	tritium	he cant get the aslamixer tool going that tells me he hasnt even got sound up and going
2005-02-24T05:29:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	"lsmod | grep snd"
2005-02-24T05:29:00.000Z	tritium	linux_galore	I see..., I just got in here a while ago
2005-02-24T05:29:00.000Z	Pinguvin		snd_atiixp and snd_pcm_oss is set to 0
2005-02-24T05:30:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	what kind of sound card?
2005-02-24T05:30:00.000Z	bc		I can't find alsa-utils, though I've got it installed.  doesn't run from Run Application dialog
2005-02-24T05:30:00.000Z	tritium	bc	"dpkg -L alsa-utils" to find out what files are in the package
2005-02-24T05:30:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	ATI Technologies Inc IXP150 AC'97 Audio Controller
2005-02-24T05:31:00.000Z	bc		thanks tritium
2005-02-24T05:31:00.000Z	tritium		sure
2005-02-24T05:31:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	is that from lspci, ?
2005-02-24T05:31:00.000Z	Pinguvin		yes
2005-02-24T05:31:00.000Z	tritium		ok
2005-02-24T05:31:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	little silver box with two round adjusters on the top that one
2005-02-24T05:32:00.000Z	crimsun	bc	usb[12]  make no difference to alsa.
2005-02-24T05:32:00.000Z	Pinguvin		cat /proc/asound/card gives me: -- no soundcards --
2005-02-24T05:32:00.000Z	bc		that's it
2005-02-24T05:32:00.000Z	mpq		well, I'm an idiot
2005-02-24T05:33:00.000Z	membreya		erm... I just overwrote my /etc/modules file, should I just lsmod it and copy and paste all running modules into it?
2005-02-24T05:33:00.000Z	mpq		I was trying to figure out why my computer was running so slow, ...it was because I was running the folding program
2005-02-24T05:33:00.000Z	bc	linux_galore	with both ubuntu and mepis, it sounds like worse than 8-bit audio
2005-02-24T05:33:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	snd-atiixp? That's an easy problem, more lengthy (but easy) to fix.
2005-02-24T05:33:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	you need a newer version of alsa-driver. 2 secs.
2005-02-24T05:33:00.000Z	Dull404		what is qt called for ubuntu?
2005-02-24T05:34:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	k :)
2005-02-24T05:34:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	hmm not much data on it when related it to Linux
2005-02-24T05:34:00.000Z	tritium		nice
2005-02-24T05:34:00.000Z	crimsun	Dull404	libqt3c102{-mt}
2005-02-24T05:34:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	you're in wicked-good hands with crimsun.  I'll let him take over here...
2005-02-24T05:34:00.000Z	Pinguvin		hehe okey thanx man
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	Dull404	crimsun	for develop... libqt3-dev ?
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	membreya		anyone? :(
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	tritium	membreya	that would be excessive
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	bc		um, something weird just happened on my laptop; hit some wrong keys while typing here in X-chat...
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	crimsun	Dull404	libqt3-{headers,mt-dev}
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	membreya		what do you suggest I do then since I overwrote it? :(
2005-02-24T05:35:00.000Z	bc		and I got an error message saying something about "suspend" not being available
2005-02-24T05:36:00.000Z	Dull404	crimsun	thanks
2005-02-24T05:36:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		hello all
2005-02-24T05:36:00.000Z	bc		Which makes me wonder, how DO i suspend, hibernate, etc a laptop?  I can't find anything in help on this
2005-02-24T05:36:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	first thing: sudo aptitude install build-essential kernel-package linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-02-24T05:37:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		I have an odd Gnome related problem if there are any takers...
2005-02-24T05:37:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	will try
2005-02-24T05:37:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	next thing: wget http://snapshot.debian.net/archive/2004/12/11/debian/pool/main/a/alsa-driver/alsa-source_1.0.7-2_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i alsa-source_1.0.7-2_all.deb
2005-02-24T05:37:00.000Z	moyogo	CubicllyContaine	we're here for that
2005-02-24T05:37:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	next thing: sudo adduser $(echo $USER) src
2005-02-24T05:38:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		With nothing but the defult desktop running, something is accessing my HDD... seems to only be present in Gnome., It's not much... 20k or so but every 4 seconds., Can't figure out what in the heck it's writing.
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	Pinguvin		crimson: thank you... i'll keep you updated :)
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	next thing: on a separate console (ctrl+alt+F2) - or log out and back in - cd /usr/src && tar xfj alsa-driver.tar.bz2
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		I have noted this in a few distros using Gnome... but only on my system.
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	next thing: sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa-source   (make sure you select atiixp, not the modem one)
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		lsof is to large and hard to understand for me to pinpoint it..., but it is a bit annoying... considering it writes 20k or so every 4 sec on the dot.
2005-02-24T05:40:00.000Z	membreya		any why isn't ndiswrapper available on synaptic???
2005-02-24T05:40:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		Anyone else note this kind of activity?

2005-02-24T05:44:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntu2u	surf?  What's that?
2005-02-24T05:44:00.000Z	Golfer		Source for the ndiswrapper linux kernel module  is this what your looking for??
2005-02-24T05:44:00.000Z	membreya	Golfer	got the source but that wants me to compile a new kernel...
2005-02-24T05:44:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		tritium really lol
2005-02-24T05:44:00.000Z	Golfer		ah ok sorry
2005-02-24T05:44:00.000Z	tritium	membreya	I would just put a few modules in your /etc/modules that you might need.
2005-02-24T05:45:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		tritium i dunno
2005-02-24T05:45:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntu2u	serious.  What is it?
2005-02-24T05:45:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	tritium	it was a stupid question
2005-02-24T05:45:00.000Z	tritium		oh, okay
2005-02-24T05:45:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	tritium	i mean port surf... like go from computer to computer trying to access things through different ports
2005-02-24T05:45:00.000Z	tritium	membreya	perhaps ide-disk, psmouse if you have PS2 mouse, mousedev
2005-02-24T05:46:00.000Z	membreya		*cries* stupid stupid me, would demsg have modules that are loaded?

2005-02-24T05:46:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	tritium	oh... you don't really know much about hacking or everything?
2005-02-24T05:46:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	tritium	ok
2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	Dull404		will debian software run on ubuntu? ... no?
2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	daniels	ubuntu2u	no, and you won't find help for that sort of thing in this channel
2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	CubicllyContaine		Well I'll repost my question in a bit... for now, it's more digging around in the system.
2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	daniels	Dull404	sort of, but all the debian packages that build at all have been recompiled and are in the ubuntu repository anyway
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	Dull404	daniels	sort of.. hm.. ok. because then i could add repos to ftp servers holding debian software - wich are maaaany :P
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	oficina		I have trouble with "make" How do you troubleshoot that? http://www.pastebin.com/241256
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	Build alsa drivers with ISA PnP support? yes/no?
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	daniels	Dull404	as i said, everything in debian that builds has been recompiled for ubuntu
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	no
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	but you definitely want oss emulation.
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	Pinguvin		ok
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	Dull404	oficina	got automake/autoconf ? good to have.....
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	oficina		no, I don't or I don't know
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	what about build alsa drivers with debugging code?
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	Dull404	daniels	so native debian wont work/stable?
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	yes.
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	daniels	Dull404	it's not recommended
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	Dull404	daniels	ok thanks
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	what drivers am i supposed to select?
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	atiixp?
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	atiixp (not atiixp modem)
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	select it with enter or..?
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	yes.
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	Pinguvin		k
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	cblack		hrm. okay, what's the trick to being able to edit the menus in gnome out of hoary? the option doesn't seem to be available with a right click like i'm used to.
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	you need moc
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	you can find moc in the qt3-dev-tools package
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	thanks, I downloaded moc, but now I get the following message http://www.pastebin.com/241257
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=2375
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	i cant cd /modules/alsa-driver
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	notice that I did not type a leading '/'
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	oh! but now i get fakeroot: command not found
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	Xenguy		Hi - a friend is having trouble copying and pasting from OOo to an aterm terminal window -- does anyone else have any problem pasting from OO ?
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	any clues?
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	ubuntu2u	tritium	i am going to sleep
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	that's not the moc you need, there's a dev-tools and an audio player, you have the audio player
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	ubuntu2u		tritium later man
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		Ok, here's another one....
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	sudo aptitude install fakeroot
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	oficina	Xenguy	try middle clicking for pastin
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		I can't seem to mount my USB flash stick...
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	install the qt3-dev-tools package
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	there is also a irc channel on this server called #creative
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		it works on most other distros...
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	remove the moc you have first of course
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	oficina	yes, that is standard, but it doesn't work for him for some reason
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	oficina		oh
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		I get an "wrong fstype" error...
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	bc	and its an official channel according to creative http://opensource.creative.com/
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	crimsun	bc	what are you trying to get working?
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		but I've defined the fs correctly.
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	NuuB	crimsun	thank you for your help last week (online now with the modem)
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	tritium	ubuntu2u	I'm back.  Oh, and good night.
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	now i get. cd: modules/alsa-driver: no such file or directory
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		Is there a problem with usb_storage and/or via chipsets in this release (4.10) with the latest k7 kernel?
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I will try that right now
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	pwd
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	Dull404		I installed k3b... how can i get it on the program list?
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	crimsun	NuuB	excellent! :)
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	pwd gives me /usr/src/modules/alsa-driver
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	so you're in the correct directory. Time to run that long fakeroot command again.
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	without the cd thing then?
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded		so yah, as I said... anyone having trouble with their usb storage media (external HDDs or flash sticks)???
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	slave		hello all !
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	linux_galore		no USB is fine here
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	apparently the qt3 thing is installed.
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	slave		I NEED HELP TO INSTALL TCSH, PLEASE HELP ?
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	what does 'moc -v' print at the command line?
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	"moc: invalid option -- v, moc 1.1.0, "
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded	linux_galore	cool... just getting a feel for bugs.
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	NuuB	crimsun	all i needed to do was remove the gateway address which ubuntu set by default during the install (your suggestion that it was in network settings pointed me in the right direction and it wasn't too long before i figred out that it was the gateway address)
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	linux_galore	CubicllyMinded	usb sound needs work though
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	da_bon_bon		to upgrade to hoary, must i do a upgrade, or a dist-upgrade
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	correct
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	Jimbob	slave	no need to yell, just run "apt-get install tcsh"
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	moc 1.1.0 is the audio player, the one you need is Qt Meta Object Compiler
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	Jimbob		(as root, I should say)
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	slave		thanks jimbob, i will try
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	what does 'dpkg-query -s qt3-dev-tools' print?
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	Pinguvin		cd modules/alsa-driver && fakeroot, debian/rules binary_modules KSRC=/usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r) KVERS=$(uname -r)
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	well, how do I get it? apparently qt3 dev libs are already installed
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	Pinguvin		oops
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	da_bon_bon		to upgrade to hoary, must i do a upgrade, or a dist-upgrade
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	crimsun		dist-upgrade
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	looking good so far
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it's qt3-dev-tools, it's extra tool on top of the libs
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	CubicllyMinded	linux_galore	well my usb flash drive works wonders in other distros... but gives a buffer i/o problem with this current setup. Odd.
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	use 'sudo apt-get install qt3-dev-tools'
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	Aeon_		anyone know how to check what version of ubuntu was installed?
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	well if tools<>libs, then I don't have it then, I will get it.
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	crimsun	thanks
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	linux_galore	CubicllyMinded	I havent tried one of those larger flash drives on my machine yet
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Aeon_	/etc/issue has it. Barring that, check the version of libc6 installed.
2005-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Aeon_	(e.g., dpkg -l libc6|grep ^ii|awk '{print $3}' )
2005-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	linux_galore		lol
2005-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	SBSP		i'm brand new to linux and just installed ubuntu.. simple question... how do i connect to the internet?
2005-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	cindux	SBSP	, your internet may have already been connected for you

2005-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	then install the .deb that you created
2005-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	Aeon_	crimsun	it returned: 2.3.2.dsl-13ub
2005-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	how? :\
2005-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	cindux		ok

2005-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	i dont remember :)
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	you know about tab-completion?  If the filename is really long, start typing the first few letters, and hit Tab.
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	cindux	SBSP	make sure you've entered all the information correctly, one wrong number or a space will ruin it all
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	thanx!!! :D
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	SBSP		i am sure.. this is the 3rd time i've tried it
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	that way you don't have to type in the whole file name :)
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	Jimbob	slave	Ok, do you have the "universe" and "multiverse" sources in your repositories list?
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	tritium	Pinguvin	did it install?
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	cindux		hm...
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	SBSP		does ubuntu come with mvdial?
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	cindux		:(
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	slave		jimbob, i will check
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	Pinguvin	tritium	yep its done
2005-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	cindux		not sure
2005-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	SBSP		i suspect it doesn't have the drivers for my winmodem.. it has a conexant chipset
2005-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	is that it?
2005-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	Jimbob	slave	There should be a line in /etc/apt/sources.list that looks like this --> "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe multiverse" <-- at least the "universe multiverse" stuff at the end.
2005-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Pinguvin	after you've installed the deb, the easiest way is to reboot
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	slave		jimbob, thanks ! i will check on it
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	Pinguvin	crimsun	will do
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	cindux		hm.., The stupid tube screensaver, freezes my pc, every single time
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	sasquatc4		i installed the 2.6.8.1 kernel documentation, but i cannot find it anywhere, where does apt actually install it to
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	aah yes conextant only offer free driver version thats crippled or an un crippled comercial driver, the un-crippled on is $$$, one*
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	ells		does anyone know of a good way to copy a dvd in linux
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	cindux		ells
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	SBSP		i see... so they sell the drivers? that doesn't sound very ethical
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	cindux		rub the dvd on a blank cd
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	ells	cindux	yes

2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	always just grab the driver off cough peer to peer cough
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	Dull404		what is a good cd/dvd writing tools for ubuntu? and movie/mp3 player ? totem player crashes when i try to play.....
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	cindux		I just want to change the color when you select something or hover ?, in ubuntus case the light brown
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	sasquatc4		i installed the 2.6.8.1 kernel documentation, but i cannot find it anywhere, where does apt actually install it to
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	SBSP		ah yes  i see a company, linuxant makes drivers for the conexant chipset, a crippled free version or a full version for 15 bucks
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	Dull404	cindux	theme?
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	cindux		?, I meant besides themes?, is their anyway I can just edit that ?, I don't even know how to create my own
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	Dull404	cindux	yes, look at themes, and you can select whatever u want to change.. list.. etc
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	SBSP		the modem isn't even worth 15 bucks.. are there any modems you'd recommend for linux use?
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	does it work now?
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	slackd00d		damn the u.s. mirrors are fast...im steadaly downloading at 377KB/s
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Jimbob	sasquatc4	If you use synaptic, there's a tab in the package description called "installed files". You can also run "dpkg -L package-name" from a terminal
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	any externals work fine
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Dull404	cindux	theme details
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	cindux		ah, see i saw that & thought it was just detailed info about who made them etc
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	SBSP		serial or usb?
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	cindux		thanks man
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I'm still on it. I'm on dialup, and I'm a bit clumsy, so I take a little longer than others. Thanks for keeping up with me though
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	serial
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	sasquatc4	Jimbob	thanks
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	get a second hand serial v92 for about $10
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Dull404	cindux	np. standard gnome thing ;)
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	SBSP		ebay?
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	cindux		ncix.com :D, SB you in Canada?
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	yeah ebay or ask a buddy or ask on your local LUG list
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	if you lived local you could have my old dial up modem for $10
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	membreya		well .. I can't be bothered recreating my /etc/modules file since I overwrote it...quick question, when I download modules and updates...are the files stored locally?
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	slave		jimbob, only "restrict" inside sources.list, this file is read only
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	SBSP		so.. ther's no such thing as a serial winmodem?
2005-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	yeah some USB modems are but I hvant heard of a "serial" winmodem
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	SBSP		one more thing... i can't read my windows partition fronm ubuntu
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	is it ntfs
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	SBSP		fat16
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	regeya		well, the winmodems don't contain a working UART IIRC; the serial port runs off a uart, so you're cool there
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	should be able to read it fine
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	SBSP		ok reg  thanks
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	regeya		http://jamesthornton.com/freebsd/articles/serial-uart/
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	Dull404		i cant install mplayer with synaptic.. is there another good movie player (for xvid,ac3,mp3) ? xine?
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	SBSP		when i open /mnt.. it is empty
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	cindux		crap lol
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	slave		jimbo, how do i edit this file ? read only !
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	cindux		what are the default icons in ubuntu ?
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	regeya		it may say 'freebsd' in the url, but it's a decent enough link
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	cindux		Crux right ?
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	SBSP		do i need to mount the win partition or something?
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	farruinn	Dull404	I like xine
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	tezza	crimsun	you around mate?
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	membreya		anyone know where the files are downloaded to when I do an apt-get? or do they get deleted?
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	tezza	aye
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	Dull404	cindux	the one on top.... i think
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	sudo mkdir /mnt/windows && mount  -t  vfat/dev/hda1  /mnt/windows
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	farruinn	membreya	/var/cache/apt or something like that
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	Dull404	farruinn	great. im getting it
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	membreya		champ :)
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	minor typo sudo mkdir /mnt/windows && mount  -t  vfat  /dev/hda1  /mnt/windows
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	dud		use dpkg -L <package> to see where the installed files goes
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	SBSP		ahh  ok ty LG
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	regeya		I stand corrected; not all winmodems lack a uart.
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	farruinn	membreya	they're only deleted if you do an apt-get clean
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	regeya		(though that's weird)
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	HappyFool		i thought it was something to do with the filtering / DSP stuff too
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	regeya		aye
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	linux_galore	SBSP	did you look under /media
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	membreya		cool..going to burn then delete
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	SBSP		mine has a dsp controller
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	cindux		just in case i screw something up
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	regeya		if I ever see a serial-based winmodem, I will smash it with a large rock
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	membreya		if I want to restore the files once I've reinstalled do I just add the cdrom as a rep in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	SBSP		i'll try that too lg
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	cindux		when in desktop preference > fonts, is their a way to simply revert them all
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	SBSP		thanks so much for your help
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	linux_galore		<-- hasnt dual booted windows in 3 years so is rusty lol
2005-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	sasquatc4		is there anyway to force an rmmod command? im tryin tto get my tuner working and it wont let me remove the one currently in use to try a new one
2005-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	linux_galore		though though Ubuntu created a mount point for windows (fat##) automatically, thought*
2005-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	sasquatc4		nm its just -f, wierd though that my modprobe arguments seem to not even have an effect
2005-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	linux_galore		one happy customer just left
2005-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	membreya	farruinn	when I reinstall ubuntu, do I just add the cd with the archives to my /etc/apt/sources.list file?
2005-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	farruinn	membreya	do you mean a cd that you burned?
2005-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	membreya	farruinn	yup...just burning the archives now
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	farruinn		because you would've needed to have included a couple of important files to use the cd as an apt repository
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	membreya		oh? like what?
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	farruinn		as it is now, you'll just have to dpkg -i *.deb
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	membreya		damn new operating systems :|
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	farruinn		there is an apt repository howto on debian's website, I don' thave the specific link
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	membreya		onto it now farruinn, thankyou so much for this :)
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	Jimbob	slave	You can edit it via the "sudo" command (e.g "sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list")
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	Jimbob	slave	If your user has the ability to edit that file, it'll prompt you for your username.
2005-02-24T06:41:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	that newdocms thing looks interesting. what do you need it for?
2005-02-24T06:41:00.000Z	Harold		I'm on hoary right now and to make mounted volumes in /media appear using nautilus as a desktop I have to restart hal each session, did nautilus do that automatically in warty or am I missing something somewhere? :)
2005-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	ok, I guess I managed to install the tools now. I check by doing "echo $QTDIR" and I get the response "/usr/lib/qt3/". Apparently there is a "moc" file at "/usr/lib/qt3/bin". HOWEVER, I *still* get the moc error! http://www.pastebin.com/241267
2005-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	It is the closest thing to a usable Document Management System implement the Liquid FileSystem theory I have ever como close to in months and months of research.
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	and it's abandoned!
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I have been at least 8 hours trying to install this and satisfying dependencies.
2005-02-24T06:44:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it sounds a bit like storage http://www.gnome.org/~seth/storage/index.html
2005-02-24T06:44:00.000Z	slave		jimbob, i got it to edit, i can install anything, except csh and tcsh
2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	You might get mad at me by what I'm about to say. To be honest, I'm currently trying to do this installation in Mandrake 10.1, not Ubuntu.    I have Ubuntu installed too, but I've heard it's a big hassle to get KDE working. Not to mention this thing. However, I have gotten used to finding very knowledgeable and helpful people at this channel, so I apologize if I'm abusing of your help
2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	pepsi		anybody get java working?, inside of firefox, it works, but applets cant get keypresses
2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	It is a cousin of storage. Except it integrates directly into every single app open/save dialog box, making it very useful to implement it with computerphobe users.
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	storage is more like a natural search engine/winfs/spotlight field, but it does not let you manage the files per se.
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	...at least, as far as I know
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I'm pulling my hair already! I tell you, I've been at least 10 hours tyring to get this to install.
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	true... i hope we go in that direction
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it seems rather annoying, eh
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	what is annoying?
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	mmm, maybe add the /usr/lib/qt3/bin to your $PATH
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	membreya		one final question before I format...why does the install CD detect and attempt to use my wireless card but once ubuntu is installed it isnt able to load it ?
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	as long as you keep pumping up suggestiions I can manage to keep hope. Thanks. Sounds dumb, but... how do I do that?
2005-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	...meaning, how do I add the path
2005-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	ok, I think I found a way
2005-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	NuuB		i thought i installed apache2 but i tried both "apachectl status" and "httpd -V" at the command line (as sudo) and it returned "command not found" both times - where am i going wrong?
2005-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	oficina		PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin, export PATH correct me if I'm wrong
2005-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	correct
2005-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	or 'set PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
2005-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	actually, i'm wrong, your way works better
2005-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it's rather strange that mandrake doesn't have moc in its path
2005-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Hallelujah! It seems it's moving forward again! brb, I'll keep you posted
2005-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	hybrid		hello
2005-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	slave		jimbob, i took out all #s, now working ok
2005-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	ok, make is chuggin away. I wonder if all that output to the screen is good or bad.
2005-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	damn. probably bad. It spit out a lot of stuff at the end again. brb
2005-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	hybrid		i am having a problem with gnome when i log into gnome normal it only opens the terminal thats it but when i go into gnome failsafe wvwrything but the application button works, any help?, *8everything, grr <---- needs sleep if you cant tell by my typing
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Here's the new output. Apparently this time it has advanced a bit more, but still chokes in the end http://www.pastebin.com/241269
2005-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Might be that frustration is blurring my eyes, but I can't seem to easily spot the troublemaker this time? Or does this mean it was able to finish the make?
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	stuNNed		whoa, the new update system rocks compared to fugly synaptic, what's it written in?
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it seems make finished clean
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	mpq		is it weird that I just use the terminal to update?
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	i mean well
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	really??!!?? woohooo!, next step then
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	farruinn	mpq	honestly, I usually only open synaptic when someone asks for help on it
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	Jimbob	slave	groovy
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I guess I shouldn't fret over those yes for Ada/C/ObjC but not C++ messages
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	mpq		I've never even opened synaptic...
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	brb
2005-02-24T07:02:00.000Z	moyogo		i find synaptic useful for browsing, see what's new
2005-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	ok, please corroborate with me that the make install has no major issues either http://www.pastebin.com/241275
2005-02-24T07:07:00.000Z	sasquatc4		how do you really force rmmod to stop a module from running, im working with my tvtuner and even after i do an rmmod -f, i still get a picture in tvtime, which shouldnt happen if its actually removed
2005-02-24T07:08:00.000Z	cindux		hm
2005-02-24T07:08:00.000Z	tweek_		i have another stpid question o.0
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	cindux		Anyone knoe if theirs a command or something that basically removes all history?
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	tweek_		stupid*, how do i get root on my ubuntu?
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	farruinn	tweek_	use sudo, and read the RootSudo wiki page
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	use sudo
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	tweek_		thanks :)
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Ok, part 2 out of 3 has been completed (about 12 thorny hours later, but hey, at least there's movement forward)
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	cindux	tweek_	also if you want to have an entire session as root, instead of typing sudo each command, sudo su
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	tweek_		can i set myself to root by default?
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	xskoulax		is hoary going to use x-org?
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	Amaranth		it already does
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	tweek_		so whenever i log in im root
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	farruinn	tweek_	that is a very bad idea
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	tweek_		howso?
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	xskoulax	Amaranth	was that directed at me?
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	Any bug in any application can wipe our your entire harddrive if you're running as root.
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	farruinn		there is the root terminal option in Computer>system> or somesuch, but generally being root all the time isn't good
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	xskoulax	Yeah.
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	xskoulax		thx Amaranth
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	cindux		he lies
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	tweek_		ok
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	cindux		log in as root amsp, lol
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	tweek_		il jsut do sudo su
2005-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	yeah the make install seems fine too
2005-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	Most of the Windows worms and trogans and such wouldn't work as well or at all if people didn't run as Administrator there. Same thing applies for Linux systems.
2005-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	sudo -s -H
2005-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	cindux		neato
2005-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	tweek_		ok ive gained root and im still getting the same error =\
2005-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	That gives you are root terminal and sets your $HOME variable to the correct value., What error?, s/are/a/
2005-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	tweek_		im trying to put plugins in mozilla
2005-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	GammaRay		what good is root if you lose your user?
2005-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	tweek_		and it says permission denied
2005-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	what's the third part?
2005-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	Not possible if you're running as root...
2005-02-24T07:14:00.000Z	tweek_		well would root only apply to the terminal?
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	GammaRay		sudo -s starts a single shell as root
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	Amaranth		nope, any program run from a root terminal would be running as root too
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Part 1 was installing sqlite. Done. Part 2 was installing the libnewdocms libraries I just finished installing. Now I'm going to Part 3, which is installing the actual GUI file dialogs. From these instructions, how thorny do you think it will be? Following is the README file for the next step http://www.pastebin.com/241278
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	GammaRay		it does not effect anything else
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	tweek_		well im not runnig a program im just trying to copy&paste into /usr/lib/xmms, and mozilla
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	sig_ubuntu	GammaRay	are you ok?
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	copy&paste?
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	You need to use the terminal.
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	tweek_		=\, i have a feeling,this will take a while
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	tweek_	sudo cp whatever.ext /usr/lib/xmms
2005-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	tweek_		is there a hotkey to start terminal?
2005-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	sig_ubuntu	tweek_	are you using gnome or kde?
2005-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	tweek_		gnome
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Before I go on, I want your expert opinion. The Readme file suggests downloading the source code for the KDE libraries the author used *at the time* of creating the software. Should I use current source code, or should I hunt the old version?
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	sig_ubuntu		yes there is
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	tweek_		ok
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	sig_ubuntu		desktop preferences > keyboard
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	dud		do Desktop -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	sig_ubuntu		you know it wouldn't hurt you to try and figure this non ubuntu stuff out.
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	tweek_		well i hit my head pretty hard today =\
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	his link to the KDE code of years ago, is, unsurprisingly, 404
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	GammaRay	sig_ubuntu	him?
2005-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	GammaRay	sig_ubuntu	hmmm? rather
2005-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	hmmm, this looks like it's gonna be tricky
2005-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I'll start diggin the path (I'm currently at http://www.gtlib.cc.gatech.edu/pub/kde/pub/kde/unstable/latest/src/ )
2005-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	yeah, I noticed *eeek*
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	GammaRay	sig_ubuntu	"am I ok?" whats
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it might be easier porting newdocms to the new kde
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	But I've worked so hard to get this far, I wanna give it a try
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	NuuB		i installed apache2 and stuff the docs say to look for are not there - can someone please help?
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	then find the source for the kde of the time
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	GammaRay		constant typos don't make one look any saner
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	but you can try with the current one first
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	c'mon. Look at me. If I have had this much trouble just following instructions, what do you think are the odd *I'm* gonna be able to port the thing?
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	tweek_		to copy multiple items in the same place to the same folder is cp blah.so,blah2.so?
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	time will tell ;)
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	tezza		has anyone been able to get their laptop to suspend/hibernate ?
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	farruinn	tweek_	no, maybe cp *.so [destination dir] 
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	GammaRay	sig_ubuntu	just trying to be prophetic
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	thanks for the pat on the back. You don't know how much I appreciate encouragement at this moment
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	it wouldn't be that hard, all you need to do is figure out what changed in kde's code to do the port
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	tweek_		ok
2005-02-24T07:22:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	actually this should work with any kde 3.x
2005-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	To be honest, I really don't know how I could find that out. What I do know though, is that the KDE project source code is many times larger than the Linux kernel itself. That's enough to put me off
2005-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	so no porting required anytime soon
2005-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	whew! thanks!!!!!
2005-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	Ok, his link isn't working, so I'm gonna go digging for an alternate path, to see if I can find something that sounds like it.
2005-02-24T07:24:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	I will keep the chat window on top in case you say something. brb
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	tweek_	farruinn	that worked but it says the folder isnt there =\, is terminal case sensitive?
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	farruinn		yes
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	tweek_		ah
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	moyogo		you can always find kdelibs' source at http://www.kde.org/download/
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	farruinn		tab completion is your friend
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	moyogo	oficina	you can always find kdelibs' source at http://www.kde.org/download/
2005-02-24T07:26:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	thanks. that seems to work better than http://download.kde.org
2005-02-24T07:27:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	nevermind last sentence
2005-02-24T07:27:00.000Z	calamari		hi
2005-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	GammaRay		My school server kicks me off after a few hours of inactivity. Any tips for stopping this? It's HP-UX and I'm logging in w/ ssh.
2005-02-24T07:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	you could set up a recurring ping - that's one idea
2005-02-24T07:29:00.000Z	mebaran151		ok, I reinstalled Hoary to clean some info off my hdd, clean format, now Evolution works, but ALSA doesnt, anybody have any ideas?, how to make sound come out
2005-02-24T07:30:00.000Z	calamari		anyone compiled shfs on Ubuntu?  I'm not sure how to compile a kernel module.. it's telling me "make[3] : *** No rule to make target `modules'.  Stop."
2005-02-24T07:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	e.g. -> ping -i 240 domain.com > /dev/null &
2005-02-24T07:30:00.000Z	tweek888		woot its working :)
2005-02-24T07:30:00.000Z	GammaRay	Xenguy	that's if I have the privs
2005-02-24T07:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	not sure what you mean
2005-02-24T07:31:00.000Z	GammaRay		privileges
2005-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	I know, but what privileges don't you have to ping a server? :-)
2005-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	GammaRay		on my home box I can't ping w/out root.  ping has to be suid root
2005-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	Xenguy		really?
2005-02-24T07:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	ls -ld `which ping`
2005-02-24T07:33:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	get kernel-package and kernel-source-*, read the directions first
2005-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	GammaRay		-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 31K 2004-08-12 17:17 /bin/ping, that's default ubuntu
2005-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	farruinn		erm, that doesn't require you to be root...
2005-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	GammaRay		no.. but it is suid root
2005-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	same as mine - and I can ping with non-root user
2005-02-24T07:35:00.000Z	tweek888		are the wine servers down?
2005-02-24T07:35:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	I have those packages.. which directions are you referring to?
2005-02-24T07:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	if it is suid root already, what is the problem though?
2005-02-24T07:35:00.000Z	mebaran151		damn ALSA, I checked my modules
2005-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		what's array 4?
2005-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	/usr/share/doc/kernel-package/README.gz
2005-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	GammaRay	Xenguy	never said there was one (-: just that I have a box in which ping isn't suid root
2005-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	Amaranth		the name of the release
2005-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	LucaBrasi	jdub said the real challenge was figuring out what array stands for, I was too tired to do it, maybe you could? :)
2005-02-24T07:36:00.000Z	daniels	Amaranth	it's on the wiki, i'm sure
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	GammaRay		anyways.. on the school server ping is executable by me and suid root, but it's just not in my PATH
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		My ALSA setup failed after a reboot and reinstall
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	thanks
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	your speech is confusing - you say you have suid root /bin/ping on your Ubu box, then you say you have a box in which ping isn't suid root -- well, which is it?
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	mebaran151		all the moduels look like they are loaded, and the mixer is ok
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	GammaRay	Xenguy	I have two boxes
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	daniels		array : hoary :: sounder : warty; hedgehog : hoary :: warthog : warty
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		whats the diff between warty and hoary
2005-02-24T07:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	are you root on both?
2005-02-24T07:38:00.000Z	GammaRay		sure.. but one of them is directly connected to the net and I'm fine w/ typing sudo ping on it
2005-02-24T07:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	daniels	That doesn't explain much. :P
2005-02-24T07:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	I'm giving up on you, sorry -- if you want good help, then you need to be clear, and not force those trying to help you to decipher your statements
2005-02-24T07:39:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		whats the diff between warty and hoary ? and is hoary just a beta ?
2005-02-24T07:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	LucaBrasi	Name of the release.
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	chillywilly		when are we going to have an hplip package for ubuntu?
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	LucaBrasi	The first version was called warty warthog, the second one is called hoary hedgehog.
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		it says on ubuntu.com that hoary is gonna be released in april 2005, but the url in topic shows that hoary is out already ..whats the deal? is it the final or just a test?
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	Amaranth		Perky Penguin creeps me out, btw.
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	crimsun	LucaBrasi	4th milestone is out. See the topic.
2005-02-24T07:40:00.000Z	chillywilly		it's a "development" version
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	LucaBrasi	It's an unstable release that they need people to test.
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	GammaRay	Xenguy	my only request for help was about staying on my school server when I'm idle. Tis all
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	chillywilly		i.e., not the official release
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	Amaranth		it's an official release, just not a final one ;)
2005-02-24T07:41:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	I'm still not sure how to get shfs to compile.. any pointers would be most helpful
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		ok I see
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	I'm aware of your problem -- it's trying to find a solution where we ran into 'vagueness' -- I've already offered what I can anyway, so that's all I have to say
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		how stable is the 4th milestone?, and can u upgrade to final hoary later?
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	i forget, is shfs a patch or is it in the mainstream kernel these days?
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	mebaran		my sndcard is an emu10k1
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	LucaBrasi	It's pretty good and yes.
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	mebaran		and it is not working
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	I don't know.. I downloaded the shfs gz off sourceforge
2005-02-24T07:42:00.000Z	mebaran		despite the fax both the mixer and the modules are set properly
2005-02-24T07:43:00.000Z	roybattius		anybody have problem getting ndiswrapper to work after a hoary upgrade?
2005-02-24T07:43:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	it should have its own README then. you'll probably have to patch the kernel sources.
2005-02-24T07:43:00.000Z	crimsun	mebaran	what does /proc/asound/modules contain?
2005-02-24T07:43:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		noticable difference between warty and hoary ?
2005-02-24T07:43:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	the readme tells me to type "make".. but it doesn't work because it's looking for a "module" rule that doesn't exist, err "modules" rule
2005-02-24T07:44:00.000Z	mebaran		I dont have modules, except as a file
2005-02-24T07:44:00.000Z	decklin		either you or the readme are skipping a few steps :)
2005-02-24T07:44:00.000Z	mebaran		/proc/asound contains Audigy2 card0 cards devices hwdep modules oss pcm seq timers version
2005-02-24T07:44:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	yeah, I think so.. :)  shfs seems like it'd be really cool, though
2005-02-24T07:45:00.000Z	Amaranth		shfs?
2005-02-24T07:45:00.000Z	calamari	Amaranth	if I can get it to compile, it should allow me to mount a remote filesystem via ssh
2005-02-24T07:45:00.000Z	decklin		it looks like you can simply install kernel-headers-2.6.10-whatever and compile the module outside of the kernel source tree
2005-02-24T07:45:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		guys whats the main difference in ubuntu .. other words, why aren't there million+ distros out there sufficient? what's new/better in ubuntu?
2005-02-24T07:45:00.000Z	GammaRay	Xenguy	I was just mentioning that perhaps the HPUX server might not let me ping as my own box does not. Then I discovered ping was just not in my PATH. problem solved.
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	decklin		or should be able to. i don't know why their makefile doesn't have the rule that their documentation is telling you to run.
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	excellent :-)
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	crimsun	mebaran	try and answer my question, please.
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	mebaran	crimsun	, I did, modules is a file
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	GammaRay		well I ran this.. well see how it goes in a few hours
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	mebaran		I can not cd into it
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	GammaRay		while true; do /usr/sbin/ping www.google.com -n 1 ; sleep 3600 ; done &>/dev/null &
2005-02-24T07:46:00.000Z	crimsun	mebaran	I'm asking you to list its contents.
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mebaran	I'm not asking you to change working directory into it.
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	shfs-source is in debian/unstable. has it hit hoary/universe yet? (i am not on my ubuntu machine)
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	mebaran	crimsun	sorry, so should I cat it?
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	crimsun	mebaran	yes
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	mebaran		0 snd_emu10k1, there you go, sorry about that
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321		I am looking to try installing ubuntu onto an amd64(with the amd64 version) on the new nforce4 motherboard. I have 2 sata disks on the nvidia ports with nvraid in raid0, however the sata_nv does not see it as '1' disk, but the 2 seperate ones. anyone else run into this problem? anyone hear anything about this issue?
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	crimsun	decklin	yes, 0.35-1 is in universe.
2005-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	mebaran		I am easily confused
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	decklin	crimsun	try doing it that way.
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	crimsun	calamari	^^
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	not sure.. downloading the linux-headers package so synaptic is busy atm
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	or as a cron job (?)
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	mebaran	Drizzt321	I had the same problem, the problem is, nvraid is really software raid
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	tweek888		is xmms just like winamp or music only?
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	yea, the nvraid is pretty much software
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	mebaran		with a speical windows driver, we dont have a linux driver yet, to read the bios
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	oh. my. so basically it don't work on linux.
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	mebaran		so you cant run the raid that way, yeah
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	GammaRay		~> crontab -e, crontab: you are not authorized to use cron.  Sorry.
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	damnit. well, thanks.
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	GammaRay		ouch
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	mebaran		just use the linux kernel raid, or use dynamic disks
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	ermm...won't work. this would be dual boot
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	GammaRay	ah well
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	mebaran		dynamic disks, can be over partitions
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	farruinn		wow, people need to learn to hit enter less in this channel
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	mebaran		and linux usually has the modules to read them
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	farruinn	heh
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	hrm?
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	mebaran		oh
2005-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	synaptic says "0.35-1 (warty)" in the versions tab
2005-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	mebaran		If you are running XP, you have a kernel raid, just like Linux has a kernel raid
2005-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	hmm...maybe NCQ is not worth the overhead of the software raid...so perhaps the silicon image raid would be better?
2005-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	ahhh, gotcha, thats how it does it.
2005-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	mebaran		kernel raid is doable just in a partition, Silicon Raid hs the exact same problem, except I think redhat has a utility to work with the raid bios, it would be a pain to load and install though
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	both are pretty much completely in software?
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	appears to be the latest version. install that and shfs-utils. the -source package should have instructions on building .debs (you'll need kernel-headers installed of course)
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	mebaran		very much so
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	crap.
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	mebaran		hardware raid, is very very expensive
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	mpq		xmms doesn't play mpeg-4 audio does it?
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	marco		how can i install xmms on my ubuntu
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	tweek888		i think it is
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	tezza		how would i mount a smb share so that a specific user can have read/write to it?
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	yea, I know. I just thought the SI chip would mask it a bit better. I know that on my old board my promise controller(for ide) would 'hide' the fact that it was seperate disks. or was that just the linux driver working?
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	mebaran	Drizzt321	but kernel raid is better anyway
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	mpq	marco	open a terminal, and type "sudo apt-get install xmms", without the quotes
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	mebaran		promise might store the driver in bios, the nv and SI drivers, are in the kernel
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	yeah.. it says to type "make deb".. but that fails in the same way as "make"
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	mebaran		promise may have managed to put in directly in the bios code, so that when you made a hdd call
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	decklin	tezza	mount -o 'uid=1234,gid=56789' ...
2005-02-24T07:53:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	the odd part is, I think I noticed that, at least under windows, the response with disk access was actually a whole lot less...which I thought was odd
2005-02-24T07:53:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	but this explains alot
2005-02-24T07:53:00.000Z	tweek888	mpq	is the synaptic packedge manager close to the effect as " sudo apt-get"?
2005-02-24T07:53:00.000Z	mebaran		it would call the bios, which would call the driver, probably hard to do
2005-02-24T07:53:00.000Z	farruinn	tweek888	yeah, synaptic and apt are both frontends to dpkg
2005-02-24T07:53:00.000Z	mebaran		but it would then be universally platform able
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mpq		yeah
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mebaran	Drizzt321	if you really want raid
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	heh, yea, but why would anyone want to do that
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mebaran		just use kernel raid
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	are you sure you should be calling make directly? building modules packages generally involves going through debian/rules.
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mpq		I think it's the same thing
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mebaran		it does the same job
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mpq		I just prefer using terminal
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mebaran		mostly as fast, and over partitions, anybody got any ideas on my sound problems
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	tweek888		k
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mebaran		in alsa
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	I'm just thinking, since it 'feels' slower in windows(which _may_ stay my primary gaming platform), I might just switch back to non-raid
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	tezza	decklin	how do i find out the uid/gid?
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	crimsun	mebaran	sound stuff is lost in the scroll, it's easier if you join #alsa
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mebaran	since when I'm doing multiple access read/write to the disks, it just slows everything else down
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	marco		i already did that
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	mebaran		cool, did not know that, thanks
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	marco		but the terminal says than the package isnt available
2005-02-24T07:55:00.000Z	decklin		id(1), or look in /etc/passwd.
2005-02-24T07:56:00.000Z	marco		but also says that there's another package that references xmms
2005-02-24T07:56:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	that's what the instructions say to do.. they don't mention Debian anywhere.
2005-02-24T07:56:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	actually, the package wit hte sources doesn't even have docs at all, except a changelog, terr the debian package with the sources, man I can't type straight right now.. sorry
2005-02-24T07:58:00.000Z	decklin		did you untar /usr/src/shfs-whatever.tar.gz?, you may need to look in modules/shfs/debian there.
2005-02-24T07:59:00.000Z	tezza	decklin	i did that but within the mounted dir now it says 1001 1001, even though i set uid and gid to 1000
2005-02-24T07:59:00.000Z	decklin	tezza	no idea. sorry.
2005-02-24T08:00:00.000Z	NuuB		where the heck is httpd?? nothing seems to fit the standard paths in the apache docs (example: the docs say "apachectl" but the system has "apache2ctl") how the hell is a novice supposed to get anywhere when stuff on the system is not the same as in the docs?? i installed ubuntu because i read it was geared more towards novices, but this is becomming infuriating. please, please, will someone help me??
2005-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	/usr/src/modules/shfs/debian has these files: changelog, compat, control, control.modules.in, copyright, rules, shfs-module-_KVERS_.postinst.modules.in
2005-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	farruinn		perhaps you haven't installed it?
2005-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	thanks a lot for your help, btw :)
2005-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	ryan_		what package is distutils in ?, .core
2005-02-24T08:01:00.000Z	decklin	NuuB	in ubuntu, every service is controlled via /etc/init.d/nameofservice. for example, /etc/init.d/apache2 start to start apache.
2005-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	marcm		hey there, anyone wanna buy an almost brand new A64 3200+nForce 3 mobo (1 week old)?
2005-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	ryan_		$5
2005-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	DAC1138		ill buy it if there's a 100% rebate
2005-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	marcm		cool
2005-02-24T08:02:00.000Z	Dull404		im getting an error when trying to compile.... i cant understand whats wrong...., checking how to run the C++ preprocessor... /lib/cpp, configure: error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check
2005-02-24T08:03:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	no idea. standard procedure is (from /usr/src/modules/shfs-whatever) fakeroot debian/rules binary
2005-02-24T08:03:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	so I type simply "fakeroot"
2005-02-24T08:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Dull404	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2005-02-24T08:04:00.000Z	decklin		fakeroot debian/rules binary, again, i really have no idea, that's just the *usual* way, keep looking for docs.
2005-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	calamari		oic.. thanks..
2005-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	You can start/stop apache with /etc/init.d/apache2 {start,stop,restart,reload,force-reload}
2005-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	calamari		if I type rules without being fakeroot it seems to do something!
2005-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	The executable itself is /usr/sbin/apache2, IIRC
2005-02-24T08:05:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	yes, it will fail eventually though. fakeroot *is* necessary.
2005-02-24T08:06:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	There's never been an httpd on debian systems as far as I know (certainly not in my usage)
2005-02-24T08:06:00.000Z	Dull404	crimsun	thanks, i hope this will work.. otherwise i dont know whats wrong....
2005-02-24T08:07:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	aha.. got it.  what do I do after running debian/rules ?
2005-02-24T08:07:00.000Z	decklin		if it successfully created ../shfs-*.deb, dpkg -i it
2005-02-24T08:07:00.000Z	fsc		ok, hoary migration complete after only about an hour or so of downloading and reverting back to ndiswrapper-1.10, well, except for xorg
2005-02-24T08:07:00.000Z	tweek_		hello o.0
2005-02-24T08:08:00.000Z	marcm		night all
2005-02-24T08:08:00.000Z	stuNNed		night
2005-02-24T08:08:00.000Z	tweek_		when i try ./configure it tells me to downgrade/upgrade,... i dont know how
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	fsc	lunitik	so it wasn't too bad except for the ndiswrapper problem.  i guess you have to do something else to upgrade to xorg
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	decklin	tweek_	when you ./configure what? give us the exact error please.
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	tweek_		want me pm you the error its big
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	this is the output of debian/rules: I've been configured using: - Kernel source of /usr/src/linux - Kernel version of 2.6.8.1 - Kernel revision of unknown - C compiler of gcc - Make options of - Version is 0.35-1 - Cosmetic version is 0.35-1 - Maintainer is calamari@localhost.localdomain - Package name is shfs-module-2.6.8.1 - Target directory is /usr/src/modules/shfs/..
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	decklin	tweek_	#flood
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	Dull404	crimsun	thank u! it worked!
2005-02-24T08:09:00.000Z	tweek_		k
2005-02-24T08:10:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	looks fine so far
2005-02-24T08:10:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	Idon't see any deb files tho
2005-02-24T08:10:00.000Z	NuuB	decklin	& Jimbob: "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start" did nothing - i did "less /etc/init.d/apache2" and it said that it basically runs apache2ctl - but /usr/sbin/apache2ctl points httpd to /usr/sbin/apache2 which is not there
2005-02-24T08:11:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	paste the rest of it in #flood
2005-02-24T08:11:00.000Z	xskoulax		little off topic but, which would be better 2x512mb ram or a single 1gb stick? for an amd64 system i'm planning to build?
2005-02-24T08:11:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	Do a "ps ax | grep apache", and see if it's actually running.
2005-02-24T08:11:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	that was the complete output :)
2005-02-24T08:12:00.000Z	fsc	xskoulax	definitely 1 gig stick.  i have a gig now and if i want another i have to buy two gig sticks now
2005-02-24T08:12:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	nothing
2005-02-24T08:12:00.000Z	fsc	xskoulax	but that's just on my laptop, so your mileage may vary since i only have two slots i believe
2005-02-24T08:12:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	The other thing to ensure is that you've got these packages installed: apache2-common, apache2-mpm-prefork, and apache2-utils installed
2005-02-24T08:12:00.000Z	xskoulax		i should have 4 slots
2005-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	fsc	xskoulax	you probably do
2005-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	daniels		33
2005-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	fsc	xskoulax	of course if you ever want more than 2 gig then you might have a problem if you go with the 2x512
2005-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	xskoulax		yea i'd thought of that
2005-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	i recall installing apache2-common, not sure about the other 2 - is there a way to check?
2005-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	xskoulax		but i don't see me needing more than 2gb
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	fsc		heh, it's amd64...you never know :)
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	xskoulax		and if i go i can always replace 2x512 with 2x2gb to wind up with 3gb
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	"apt-get install apache2-common apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-utils"
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	xskoulax		umm 2x1gb even
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	Or "apt-cache showpkg <pkgname>"
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	Archon		does 'df' display the swap partition
2005-02-24T08:14:00.000Z	xskoulax		yea i think i'll go with the 512mb sticks at least then i should be good on pairings
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	stuNNed		anyone else have their internet connect slow to a crawl with ubuntu hoary?
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	crimsun		works fine here.
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	decklin	calamari	do you have module-assistant installed?
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	At the the top of the apt-cache output there should be a version number followed by a "(some_long_uri_like_filename)(/var/lib/dpkg/status)"
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	decklin		i notice the shfs .deb mentions that.
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	stuNNed	crimsun	thanks
2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	If the "(/var/lib/dpkg/status)" part isn't there, then it isn't installed
2005-02-24T08:16:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	checking... yes
2005-02-24T08:16:00.000Z	Jimbob		Alternatively, you could just open the "Package Manager", click the "search" button in the toobar, enter "apache2" --> anything with a green box next to it is installed.
2005-02-24T08:16:00.000Z	linusthepenguin		Anyone know how to enable php4? I got the packages installed... any configuration I have to do in apache2.conf or otherwise?
2005-02-24T08:16:00.000Z	Dull404		mark for removal & complete removal.... in synaptic, whats the difference?
2005-02-24T08:17:00.000Z	crimsun	Dull404	remove versus --purge remove
2005-02-24T08:17:00.000Z	decklin	Dull404	the latter purges your configuration files.
2005-02-24T08:17:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	mod_php or php-cgi?
2005-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	Dull404	crimsun	ah so config will be left with removal and not "complete removal"
2005-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	Dull404	decklin	thanks
2005-02-24T08:20:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	module-assistant was able to do it! :)
2005-02-24T08:20:00.000Z	calamari	decklin	very cool program... thanks for mentioning it
2005-02-24T08:20:00.000Z	decklin		great
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	linux-rulz		Is there anyone else here that compiled XFCE 4.2 on Ubuntu?
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	crimsun	linux-rulz	yes.
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	Orcrist		I have
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	linux-rulz	crimsun	did you notice that if you put the optimization settings on (i used the graphical installer) that XFCE was very unstable, ?
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	crimsun	linux-rulz	no, I've been cleaning up the debianized source
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	linusthepenguin	Jimbob	general php... I suspect mod_php... Trying to run wordpress...
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	Orcrist		mine didn't seem unstable, and I used optimizations for both the main package and the add-ons one
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	linux-rulz		hmmm...weird
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	Orcrist		I've got it installed on the box next to me in fact... using it for a project I'm working on
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	linux-rulz		parts of my desktop wouldnt load, a bunch of other crap was broken, so I created a new user, same thing happened, so i compiled it without optimizations and it seemed to work better
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	fsc	jdub	thanks for the heads up on evince.  it seems to render better than gpdf...it better since i just upgraded to Hoary for it :)
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	ok, apache2-common is installed, apache2-mpm-prefork nothing came up under versions, and it was unable to locate apache2-utils
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	Orcrist		what parts/problems did you have?, did you install the GTK engine as well or just the basic package?
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	fsc		anybody notice that About Ubuntu in the Desktop menu doesn't work
2005-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	mindphasr	fsc	Works fine for me
2005-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	fsc	mindphasr	About Gnome works for me
2005-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	linux-rulz	Orcrist	I installed the packages in the order in which they said to. First the main XFCE package, then the gtk engine package, then xfce-toys and then the terminal emulator....all compiled from source
2005-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	mindphasr	fsc	Its a link, it opens up your default browser
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	Orcrist		speaking of pdf reading... I downloaded some pdf tax forms with gpdf... and while the forms were designed to let you fill them out locally and print them... gpdf seems to lack this function, worked fine on a windows box using adobe reader
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	Ok, run "apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork" to install that (that package provides the actual apache2 executable).
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	Orcrist		do you have to enable that or is it just a caveat of gpdf?
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	fsc	mindphasr	why wouldn't it do what About Gnome does? it doesn't open a browser
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	linux-rulz	Orcrist	you have to download acrobat reader for Linux from Adobe's website
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	mindphasr	fsc	Go ahead and write a about window if you like
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	fsc	Orcrist	I just installed Hoary just so I could use evince
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	Orcrist	linux-rulz	right:  you must have used the tutorial for ubuntu
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	To ensure you're using mod_php, you need to install libapache2-mod-php4
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	mindphasr	fsc	It does open a browser. It's a link to file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html\
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	mindphasr	fsc	It does open a browser. It's a link to file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	fsc	mindphasr	ok, you're right
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	fsc	mindphasr	my bad.  i thought it would do what About Gnome does
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	It should put "php4.conf" and "php4.load" symlinks in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	Orcrist	fsc	does evince let you do that kind of thing? it really made me mad that I had to print them and then fill them in by hand, when the whole reason I d/l the pdf was to have clean forms that were typed in
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	linux-rulz	Orcrist	no, i just went to xfce.org, clicked on graphical installers and it sent me to another site and then it said there what order to do them in
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	fsc		hah, i didn't even see it open
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	Then it's just a matter of restarting apache2.
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	fsc	Orcrist	the evince guys seem to be on the ball as gpdf development stagnated so you might want to give it a try.  it's like 500k download if you're on Hoary
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	Orcrist		well, linux-rulz, if you did it that way there shouldn't be a whole lot of difference... the ubuntu tutorial basically tells you the same thing as the xfce one does but it's a little more intuitive
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	For php-cgi, you need to ensure cgi.load/conf symlinks exist in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	Orcrist	fsc	not on hoary yet... just going to wait until april to upgrade
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	I'd recommend mod_php, personally.
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	Orcrist		but when I go there I'll give it a look, sounds nice
2005-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	Jimbob	linusthepenguin	It's faster than php-cgi.
2005-02-24T08:28:00.000Z	linux-rulz		hmmmm....oh well, i was more curious than anything, XFCE seems to be running fine without the optimizations, and i obviously dont notice a speed difference because i have never used it with the optimizations.
2005-02-24T08:29:00.000Z	Orcrist	linux-rulz	on decent hardware you probably won't notice anything... I used a p2 350 box for xfce and it made a significant difference, if you've got a fairly modern system, you're probably just fine without the tweaks
2005-02-24T08:29:00.000Z	linux-rulz		AMD Athlon XP 2200+ with 512 MB RAM, so it is fairly good, albeit a bit dated
2005-02-24T08:29:00.000Z	Orcrist		I like xfce though... nice and clean... very light, the interfaces are less than intuitive for some things... but I've yet to find an interface from windows to gnome to kde to fluxbox to whatever that has everything down pat... interfaces are a matter of personal preference
2005-02-24T08:31:00.000Z	linux-rulz	Orcrist	exactly, i like the way it autohides the taskbars...it just seems cleaner than the windows, kde and gnome ways of doing it. There probably isnt much difference. probably just my imagination
2005-02-24T08:31:00.000Z	Orcrist	linux-rulz	you can also use cool things like gdesklets on xfce... it's compliant
2005-02-24T08:32:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS	Orcrist	you can use gdesklets also on gnome ;-)
2005-02-24T08:32:00.000Z	Orcrist		so you can get a little eye candy and a slick environment and still save the overhead, aye FLeiXiuS, and I do, I was just happy to find they played nicely with xfce as well :)
2005-02-24T08:32:00.000Z	linux-rulz		is that what they mean when they say it complies witht he freedesktop.org specs?
2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	Orcrist		because the box I run it on (mostly as a backup box for when I'm in full-screen game mode and want chat/teamspeak/wahtever) only has 128 megs of RAM, with xfce running and mozilla, xchat, and teamspeak running the total commit for memory was around 70 megs, and used next to zero swap
2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	linux-rulz		Ubuntu should offer a trimmed down version of Ubuntu with XFCE called "Ubuntu Lite" or something like that for people with slower computers
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	it came back with "Package apache2-mpm-prefork is not available, but is referred to by another package."
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	Orcrist	linux-rulz	you may see ubuntu offer something like that in the future... they try to focus on ergonomics and user-friendliness
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS		Have you seen the slackware install /, I love the install for slackware, one of the bests out there
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	Orcrist		I wouldn't be suprised to see an installer with options for one of 3 or 4 window managers as default in the future.. but right now they're focusing all their support on gnome
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	jdub	Orcrist	that won't happen, however
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS		Not only was it nice, but it alowed you to select between 7-8 window managers
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	jdub		kubuntu is coming
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	Orcrist		oh really, jdub?, that's very cool
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	jdub	FLeiXiuS	that certainly won't be happening in ubuntu
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	Orcrist		I figured you guys were getting around to adding other things
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	farruinn		haha, which is the polar opposite of xfce ;-)
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	jdub		i think xfce sits between gnome and kde
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	linux-rulz		i dont understand why they focus so heavily on kde. most distros are already centered around kde, the ubuntu devs should instead release the XFCE Ubuntu or some other lightweight WM/DE.
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	jdub		it's light, sure, but there's a heck of a lot of clicky-clicky stuff on the screen
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS		i think flux sits between them 2
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	Orcrist		I'd be inclined to agree to that, jdub, esp considering their "kde/gnome support engines"
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	membreya		gaaaah
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	Jimbob		Nuub: You're using warty?
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	daniels	FLeiXiuS	allowing you to choose between window managers is fantastic, and we should certainly encourage it.  *making* you choose between window managers is a showstopper bug, not a feature.
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	jdub	linux-rulz	'the ubuntu devs should...'? what are you going to do?
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	membreya		can I do ONE install without something screwing up
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	yes, warty
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS	daniels	I concur
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	Orcrist		you have a point daniels, but I think as an 'expert-only' option or something you get the flexibility withotu forcing the user to choose if they want a simple, intuitive install
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	farruinn		you're going to fit multiple window managers on one install cd? good luck
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	linux-rulz		lol, donate money...cause i couldnt code if my life depended on it. all my code would be rewritten cause i would do it shitty (lol, at least im honest)
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	Jimbob		Nuub: Umm, it's in the "main" repo, it should be available.
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	FLeiXiuS	farruinn	It's definately possibly
2005-02-24T08:39:00.000Z	Orcrist		of course, you could go the windows route and have the user choose between crappy XP interface number one or... oh wow, crappy XP interface number one
2005-02-24T08:39:00.000Z	Jimbob	NuuB	Search for a line in /etc/apt/sources.list that looks something like "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main..."
2005-02-24T08:39:00.000Z	membreya		anyone had any trouble installing nvidia-glx?, getting a clash with  xorg-driver-fglrx
2005-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	linux-rulz	jdub	by should i also meant "In my opinion it would be smarter to do such and such" not "this is what i demand of them right now!"
2005-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	if things were going that smoothly for me, i may not have had to resort to asking for help on IRC, ya know?
2005-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	jdub	linux-rulz	mmm, but what are you going to do? :)
2005-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_		how can i get KDE? sudo apt-get install kde says that kde does not exist
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	Orcrist	membreya	everything okay in your xorg config?
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	searching...
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	linux-rulz	jdub	ummm...did you read my post further up? I said in plain english how i was going to contribute...you must have missed it
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	membreya		looks to be orcist..its still using the nv driver
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	jdub	ubuntu_	enable universe
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	membreya		its conflicting at libGL.so.1.xlibmesa, was just about to suggest repos jdub :P
2005-02-24T08:42:00.000Z	randabis		you should sudo apt-get install kde-core not just kde
2005-02-24T08:42:00.000Z	Orcrist	membreya	post your error messages in #flood... I had a similar problem when I switched cards last time
2005-02-24T08:42:00.000Z	randabis		unless you want 50 billion lines of bloat
2005-02-24T08:43:00.000Z	linux-rulz	jdub	hmmm...apparently with free software i no longer have the right to make a suggestion...those pro-proprietary people were right, open source steals your rights in unseen ways
2005-02-24T08:43:00.000Z	membreya		done Orcrist :)
2005-02-24T08:43:00.000Z	linux-rulz		:P
2005-02-24T08:43:00.000Z	Orcrist		coo
2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	it is commented - i will uncomment it
2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	membreya		any suggestions Orcrist ?
2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	Jimbob		Nuub: Ok, after you do that run "apt-get update", then "apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork"
2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	mebaran		I have an Alsa problem
2005-02-24T08:45:00.000Z	NuuB	Jimbob	k
2005-02-24T08:45:00.000Z	jdub	linux-rulz	better than suggestion, you can *contribute*
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	jdub	linux-rulz	that's hundreds of times more powerful
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	Orcrist		well... this isn't quite like the problem I had... but you could try renaming the fglrx mesa lib to fglrx.libmesa.foo.old or whatever
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	maximaus		good morning from Sweden. :D
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	Orcrist		and see if that clears it up
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	membreya		thought so ..didn't want to hurt my system AGAIN
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	mebaran		Anyone know how to clear the alsa mixer lock file and settings
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	membreya		god ...like 2 hours ago I overwrote my /etc/modules :|
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_		thanks jdub, now to remove gnome...
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	Orcrist		the restricted modules don't like to play together very nicely... I had the reverse of your problem.. i had to hide some of my nvidia stuff to keep fglrx from finding conflicts
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	maximaus		I'm running the Ubuntu live CD in the Eggers Hotel lobby and no one's the wiser.
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	IRCMonkey_		Can anyone help me in setting up the sound card? ac '97 on via  vt 8235
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	linux-rulz		jesus bloody christ, i said in plain friggin english, me donating money would be a lot friggin easier and more resourceful then actually contributing cause i cant code worth shit....would me donating my house and car make you happy?
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	mebaran		Anybody want to help troubleshoot a weird alsa mixer problem
2005-02-24T08:47:00.000Z	Orcrist		in fact, something was loading my nvidia modules before it ever got to fglrx... and that was zero fun
2005-02-24T08:48:00.000Z	jdub	linux-rulz	no, donating is less effective. you know that i don't code, right? :-)
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	Orcrist	linux-rulz	contributing can be something as small as accurately documenting a bug when you find it and submitting it to a respective package/distro's bugzilla
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	daniels	linux-rulz	language, please
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	Orcrist		that kind of thing is invaluable, and doesn't take much effort even
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	maximaus	IRCMonkey_	I'm also having sound card issues with my cousin's computer. Away from it at the moment--what's a quick way to find out what model the sound card is?
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	mebaran		what module does it use
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	mebaran	maximaus	
2005-02-24T08:49:00.000Z	linux-rulz		well i do all that....i never said i didnt
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	membreya		going to go to a console....i cant get red of that error message
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	maximaus	mebaran	excuse me I'm at the hotel at the moment
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	Orcrist		then you're already contributing a little... so feel good about that
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	mebaran		oh
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	Orcrist		and send your donations to me instead :) i'm poor
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	maximaus		LOL so I'll log in late on his box. :P
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	mebaran		heheh
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	maximaus		running Ubuntu on the Hotel's puter :D
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	mebaran		to find out quickly you have to sort of be sneaky about it, you could open the computer
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	maximaus		tell me more
2005-02-24T08:50:00.000Z	mebaran		or, you could just look at the gnome device manager
2005-02-24T08:51:00.000Z	maximaus		I'm such a knucklehead--where do you find it in the device manager?
2005-02-24T08:51:00.000Z	Orcrist		maxiamaus... you could also shell into the computer and type lspci or lsmod to find out the info/module on it
2005-02-24T08:53:00.000Z	maximaus	Orcrist	thanks! It's probably an on-board, so I guess lspci wouldn't help. I'll try lsmod and report back with ya'll.
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	dud		or lshw just to be sure to catch it no matter what
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	Orcrist		lspci might still do it maximaus, as many on-board soundboards are still integrated into the pci bus
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	mebaran		on board sound
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	er, you do know ubuntu has a 'custom' option (now named 'server' for hoary) that allows you to totally customise your install in terms of which packages you use, right?
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	maximaus		gotcha :D
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	mebaran		is 99/100 oing to be AC 97 sound, if it is not some exotic mother board, it is going to be ac 97 sound, or at least ac 97 sound will work
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	Orcrist	daniels	yes.. I've installed it that way recently in fact... gave me a really tiny base install that I used to build a custom setup
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	dud		yeah... absolutely...
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	maximaus		I'm on vacatin and don't have my little cheat sheet with me for shell commands. :P Thanks all.
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	mebaran		anyone know what could be wrong with my set up, I have an emu10k1 card, Audigy 2, the mixer looks fine
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	tweek_		:), i learned howto compile
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	ahr, cool
2005-02-24T08:56:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	well, if that's what you enjoy, then more power to you, but i don't want to have to pick up the phone and explain to my mum what a window manager is when she's installing ubuntu :)
2005-02-24T08:56:00.000Z	IRCMonkey_		Help me please!!!! i want to configure my sound card. ac '97 oni vt 8235
2005-02-24T08:56:00.000Z	tweek_		should work by default, i beleive
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	dud		one exlamation point will suffice....
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	daniels	IRCMonkey_	should just work by default -- mine (also vt8235) certainly did
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	tweek_		and one period.
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	Orcrist		lol not suggesting that :)  I was suggesting that the default install could do just waht the default install does now... but another 'custom' option would allow you to select something like fce-only.. without having apt-get the stuff
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	tweek_		;P
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	IRCMonkey_		mine is not working....
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	dud		touch
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	tweek_		lol
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	Orcrist		the warty custom option gave me a base system... but unless you know what you're doing from there you're kind of stuck in a few ways
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	tweek_		if warty was a women =\, watch out
2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	daniels	Orcrist	mmm, interesting, but if you know enough to be picking which window manager you want to install and that you absolutely don't want to install gnome, you probably know how to install from a base system
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	ubuntu_		how do I get rid of all traces of gnome?
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	tweek_		why :(
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	maximaus		use Xandros...
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	tweek_		killing gnomes isnt nice
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	Orcrist		good point... but some people have the knowledge and still don't want the hassle... however... to your point that also kind of negates the need for such a thing on an installer
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	ubuntu_		would deleting gnome affect my system as a whole, or just gnome?
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	tweek_		yay! i compiled MPlayer!, :)
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	mebaran		tweek, you could have just pulled it off the repos
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	tweek_		it wasnt working
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	Orcrist		gmplayer doesn't work for me either from repos, I had to compile from source, and there doesn't seme to be a decent GTK frontend for it anywhere, Kplayer is super... but I dislike qt to the point of it giving me a headache
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	jdub	ubuntu_	wait for kubuntu CDs
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	tweek_		orc: gtk = gui?
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	daniels	pitti	good afternoon
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	Orcrist	tweek_	no... gtk is a gui framework... not a standalone gui
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	tweek_		k
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	pitti		Hi daniels
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	Orcrist		it's what controls the look, feel, and functionality of all your buttons/scrollbars/file menus/ whatever... you use all that to build a gui for a program
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	pitti	daniels	although it is Sunday morning here :-)
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	mebaran		hmmm
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	daniels	pitti	heh, close enough ;)
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	Orcrist		if a program runs from the command line and has no gui... you can create one from the gtk toolkit (which is what gnome is based on) and it's very nice and integrated, however, there doesn't seem to be a good gtk one for mplayer, inculding the one that comes with gmplayer
2005-02-24T09:03:00.000Z	maximaus	Orcrist	I thought gmplayer was pretty nice last time I tried it--mind you that was a year ago on Fedora--what's the problem with the gui?
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	Orcrist	maximaus	really it's the options and the old generic flavor of it, the playlist support is really bad, and the the interface isn't slick like the rest of my GTK2 gnome desktop... it kind of reminds me of win95
2005-02-24T09:05:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	are you still around?
2005-02-24T09:05:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	or have you gone to sleep?
2005-02-24T09:05:00.000Z	Orcrist		I think they focus more on the guts of it... and they do a damn fine job... esp with parts of it like mencoder, It'd be nice to see an open-source project just to beautify/functionize mplayer... and I may start one on my own (already talked to some friends about it) and for simplicity I'm learning how to use Glade2, all the effort in taht regard seems to be towards KDE
2005-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	oficina	moyogo	?
2005-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	scorpix		when the next beta will release for Ubunut?

2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	mebaran		anybody here know how to troubleshoot an ALSA problem
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	Orcrist		man I need to get to bed... got to go do some taxes tomorrow, night all
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	mebaran		I checked the modules
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	oficina		Is there anybody with the approximate knowledge of moyogo or his hubris?
2005-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	maximaus		Ocrist, yeah you're right about gmplayer not being slick--still beats stock mplayer. I'm satisfied with Totem for my modest needs.
2005-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	h8crime		hello?
2005-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	maximaus		lo

2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	mebaran		anybody want to fix some ALSA
2005-02-24T09:21:00.000Z	h8crime		i am willing
2005-02-24T09:21:00.000Z	mebaran		haha, you didnt even know what alsa was
2005-02-24T09:21:00.000Z	h8crime		i do now, Alsa makes soudn
2005-02-24T09:22:00.000Z	mebaran		sound

2005-02-24T09:23:00.000Z	mebaran		yeah, I know
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		Hi, I'm having trouble with my cd drive it seems its not even being detected, there is no /dev/hdc, does anyone know what I can do to get it working? :)
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	mebaran		hmmm, that is a hard one, is the module ide-cd loaded
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		i'll take a look
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	oficina		.
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		i don't think it was.., i'd have to reboot for it to create the device wouldn't i?
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		or go back to init one
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		but i'd also have to make sure ide-cd is loaded
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		easier to reboot, as udev is run fairly early
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		how do i do that, :)
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		jsut reboot
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		yeah, ok, but shouldn't i make sure ide-cd gets loaded first?, hmm, i just want /dev/hdc! :), stupid thing
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	mebaran		nah, the order wont matter, udev is constantly one
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		well ide-cd was already loaded.., ah ok, well
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	grahamoz		ney
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		any ideas?
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	grahamoz		hey, is wireless network supported in ubuntu
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		sure is i'm using it right now :), but it might depend on the network card you have
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	grahamoz		usb adapter
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	mebaran		what do you have in /dev
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	grahamoz		wg111
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		you want everything?
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	grahamoz		what ?
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley	mebaran	in /dev it looks normal except it doesn't have hdc or hdd :)
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	mebaran		how many hdd's do you have, do you hae anything called sda
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		i just have one sata hdd, yeah its sda
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	mebaran		then what is taking up the other spots
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		my hdd is sda and my cdrom drives should be hdc and hdd, but there is no hdc or hdd.. :/
2005-02-24T09:43:00.000Z	mpq		what will play .m4a files?
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	mebaran	mpq	, if it aint windows, mplayer will play it, if it is, it still might, mplayer, does everythign, udner the sun
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	mpq		heh
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		well dmesg | grep hdc shows nothing.. :/
2005-02-24T09:46:00.000Z	mebaran		what does your dmesg say
2005-02-24T09:46:00.000Z	pepsi	Mr_Smiley	warty or hoary?
2005-02-24T09:46:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		warty, it just seems that its not creating the node hdc
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	pepsi		i had this problem after upgrading to hoary.. dmesg could tell me the make and model of my cdrom, but /dev/hdc wasnt there.. hal-device-manager saw something on the ide chain, but couldnt tell what it was
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	mebaran		heheh, what does your bios report
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	pepsi		i gave up and reinstalled with the latest hoary iso
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	mebaran		sounds like a weird problem, add sg
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		yeah bios sees cdrom fine
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	mebaran		try adding sg, to your modules, that is genereally scsi emulation
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		ok
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	mebaran		modprobe sg, first, just to see, if it helps, my alsa is going similarly
2005-02-24T09:50:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		lol, well i've got nearly everything working except no cd drive :)
2005-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	mpq		does mplayer support mp3pro?
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		brb i'll try reboot
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	mebaran		mp3pro will paly, I dont knwo if it takes adavantage
2005-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	mpq		I just know that it sounds HORRIBLE without the codec
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	mebaran		well mplayer reads it, xmms reads it, from live365, and sounds ok, the 64 K streams
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	mpq		I guess...
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	mebaran		the low k ones sound pretty bad
2005-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	mpq		I know, the one I'm talking about is 32k, and it sounds absolutely awful in anything other than winamp, mp3pro is stupid
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	mebaran		mp3pro is a hack, a silly stupid, hack
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	mpq		but it's not like I have a choice, they don't broadcast in any other format
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	mebaran		haha, yeah, I guess, xmms, did ok, with, with it
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	mpq		they have 32k mp3pro so they can brag about "cd-quality sound on dial-up"
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mebaran		haha
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mpq		as long as you're running winamp
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mebaran		as if, not even then, with ogg, which is better than mp3pro, and free, you arent going to pull that out of 32 K
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mpq		a monkey is better than mp3pro
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mebaran		you need at least 128 K, to get anywhere near
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mpq		and I'm not talking about .ape
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	mebaran		if you own some good speakers, haha
2005-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	mpq		who's idea was it to make a lousy format lousier?, *whose
2005-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	viper12		I think 96k sounds pretty decent...listening to a streaming station right now with xine at 96k. (5.1 surround sound)............sounds pretty decent to me. ;)
2005-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	mebaran		96 K, is pretty good
2005-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	viper12		lol... hey there meb
2005-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	mpq		mono or stereo?
2005-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	pepsi		(_)_)
2005-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	mebaran		ok, anybody wwant to kix my alsa
2005-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	viper12		stereo mpq
2005-02-24T10:01:00.000Z	mebaran		hi Viper12
2005-02-24T10:02:00.000Z	mpq		you must not be much of an audiophile, I can hear problems with 128k mp3, which is why I stopped encoding in mp3
2005-02-24T10:02:00.000Z	viper12		mpq.........when I want audiophile.........I take disc out in the living room with 7.1 surround system.  I'm just saying that 96k is decent for casual listening. (unlike 32k.  snicker.)
2005-02-24T10:02:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley		that worked..
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	mebaran		96 K, is damn good, lame considers 128 K to be equal to CD
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	mpq		that's lame
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	mebaran		haha a pun
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	viper12		lol
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	mpq		it was asking for it
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	mebaran	mpq	you are so ....  punful
2005-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	viper12		groans......but lol
2005-02-24T10:04:00.000Z	mpq		it wasn't great, you want good puns, you should read spider robinson
2005-02-24T10:04:00.000Z	viper12		felt like an utter noob earlier.........was pissin' and moaning about performance issues with graphics............forgot I'd loaded 386 kernel to test some stuff....gads.
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	excession		hi
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	viper12		hola excess, got awful quiet again.
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	Neil3		morning all
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		morning
2005-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	Neil3		:)
2005-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	NuuB		i am doing some apt-get installs, and each time i try to visit a website it cant find the site, then once the download and install is complete i can get to the website fine. is there a way to still surf the web while an apt-get is running?
2005-02-24T10:32:00.000Z	apokryphos		It's just choking up all your connection, I presume. No real way to limit the download limit of apt, as far as I know.
2005-02-24T10:32:00.000Z	Neil3		apt-get is probably taking up your bandwidth, i use traffic shaping on my router which does get around this pretty well
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	NuuB		yeah, that much i figured on - i was hoping there might be a way to leave at least a small hole so i can keep surfing in the meantime, no router
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	Neil3		i'm not sure but you might be able to use a traffic shaping script on your machine
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	NuuB		just ubuntu and a 56k serial modem
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	Neil3		since my router runs linux, its called wondershaper, and you'd have to edit it for your connection speed and stuff
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	viper12		quick question.....surfin the ubuntu site......it seems everyone is using the sb brand sound cards.......anyone have the turtle beach products?  curious.
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	daniels		if anyone here is using a desktop with an integrated video chipset and also a pci/agp video card, please /msg me
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	Neil3	daniels	you should ask your question in the channel :)
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	NuuB		i'll do a search for it, thanks
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	Neil3		np
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	tuppa_		gah, why oh why is fakeroot not doing what it suppose to do?
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	daniels	Neil3	need the output of lspci, lspci -nX, sudo ddcprobe, some probing as to which card the output of ddcprobe relates to, and some other stuff that I'm not sure about yet :)
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	viper12		I'm using an IBM e-server with integrated vid (turned off) and a nvidia fx5200 agp card.
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	Neil3		quite a lot of stuffage
2005-02-24T10:37:00.000Z	daniels	Neil3	i'm aware of the staggering lameness of 'any1 know how configga x /msg me plz', but this is a little more complex, and will help with ubuntu development ;)
2005-02-24T10:37:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		because you didn't ask it nicely tuppa? :P
2005-02-24T10:38:00.000Z	tuppa	Tsjoklat	that's one possible solution
2005-02-24T10:38:00.000Z	Neil3		its not lame at all mate, from what i see of this channel, people are more friendly than some of the other places, and the forum is really cool, i dont see much flaming, and bad attitude, unlike some other places i could mention ;)
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	daniels	Neil3	the code of conduct does wonders, it seems
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	Neil3		aye
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	NuuB	Neil3	which version of wondershaper do you use? (1.0 or 1.1a)?
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	Neil3		i dont know haha it is included with ipcop, i would guess its the latest
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	viper12		havta agree with you there neil3...an article online I was reading mentioned that ubuntu had some of the best online 'peeps'......and recommended the distro over a couple other becuase of it.
2005-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	Neil3		but NuuB you can't go wrong with trying either as they are only scripts, just use another if the first doesnt work, yeah i read that too
2005-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		does anyone know the module i have to load for a via-gigabit ethernet driver? It's a soyo dragon kt880 i believe the nic is VT6122
2005-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	NuuB	Neil3	k, thanks
2005-02-24T10:49:00.000Z	viper12		game master......not sure how much help this is.....here's the page with current wired network card support:, http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HardwareSupportComponentsWiredNetworkCards/view?searchterm=gigabit, I don't show it listed, but hey, was a quick search.
2005-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		thanks alot Viper12 ^_^, I'll check it ou, out*
2005-02-24T10:52:00.000Z	viper12		I see that the via 6102 Rhine chipset is supported natively. (warty)., this page shows systems that are supported by ubuntu.....with various hardware chipsets and such listed:, http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HardwareSupportMachinesDesktops/view?searchterm=gigabit, toward the bottom, an hp machine is running the via setup with that Rhine nic.
2005-02-24T10:55:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		cool, thanks Viper12, It turned out to be the via-veolcity driver, I'm using that in 2.6.8 and it's working, thanks SO much for your help ^_^
2005-02-24T10:55:00.000Z	viper12		notta problem.........its what we're all here for. :)
2005-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		hehe, well don't go too far away, sound is next on mylist ;)
2005-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	viper12		gawds.........seems like its on a lotta peeps lists.  lol.  I'm using sb live and alsa drivers.............no issues.  I'm thinking about building a box with a santa cruz card though....not seeing anything one way or another on that one.
2005-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	TheMuso	viper12	I think a lot of the problems people have are with onboar dsound., s/onboar/onboard
2005-02-24T10:58:00.000Z	viper12		which is WHY its the first thing I kill in bios before even starting a build.  lol.  onboard usually means (excluding nics)..........twwwoouuubbblllee.
2005-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		yea I never had problems with alsa and sb live/audigy cards, only alsa and ac97/intel based onboard sound
2005-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	TheMuso		A lot of shortcuts are taken when integrating onboard sound from what I can gather.
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		brb
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	viper12		ac97 is squirrly at best. Sometimes it works with no hassle........others it blows up badly.........from reading the forums it makes no sense., of course ac97 chipsets are all over the place.......almost like flavor of the month.
2005-02-24T11:07:00.000Z	Zotnix		Blargh.
2005-02-24T11:08:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		nobody to eliminate Zotnix?
2005-02-24T11:09:00.000Z	Zotnix		Tried updating to blam-1.6.1 manually., No work. So back to 1.4 for me
2005-02-24T11:09:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		oh dear
2005-02-24T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		Weird errors and not even google found anything., So I'll use the blam package., wait..., Ubuntu uses 1.6 now, Yay
2005-02-24T11:13:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		why build it then
2005-02-24T11:15:00.000Z	Zotnix		I thought hoary used 1.4 (which it did, for awhile) which uses a bad rendering engine that hangs on images. In 1.6 they switched to gtkmozembed which proved to be much faster.
2005-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		should have checked first
2005-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	Zotnix		So I was going to switch to 1.6 manually since I referred it., I had checked a bit ago. Didn't realize it was updated now.
2005-02-24T11:17:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		it updates every minute!
2005-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	cyklus		im having problems with xmms, it starts fine but when i try to play an mp3 it freezes, however mpg123 can play an mp3 fine... anyone know what might be up?
2005-02-24T11:19:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		it's somewhere on the wiki cyklus

2005-02-24T11:38:00.000Z	Adrenal		i just installed samba, how do i mount a folder so my windows machine can see and copy it through a lan?
2005-02-24T11:42:00.000Z	desplesda		hi, i just upgraded to the latest hoary, and /dev/dsp's disappeared, wait, sorry, warty, latest warty
2005-02-24T11:42:00.000Z	Adrenal		press enter less
2005-02-24T11:43:00.000Z	desplesda		apologies
2005-02-24T11:43:00.000Z	ssamf		did the upgrade complete with no problems
2005-02-24T11:44:00.000Z	desplesda		yes, there weren't any problems
2005-02-24T11:44:00.000Z	ssamf		sometimes synaptic looks like its done when in fact it has had to stop
2005-02-24T11:44:00.000Z	desplesda		hmm, well, can i create the device node manually?
2005-02-24T11:44:00.000Z	ssamf		i'd run it again just in case
2005-02-24T11:45:00.000Z	desplesda		run which function?, upgrade?
2005-02-24T11:45:00.000Z	ssamf		run synaptic again, yes
2005-02-24T11:45:00.000Z	desplesda		i hit mark all upgrades, but apply didn't become accessible
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	ssamf		i think with udev you should not make your own device nodes
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	cyklus		what is the shortcut keys to jump between workspaces in gnome?
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	desplesda		i know
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	bob2		yup
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	lunitik	desplesda	probably means there are no upgrades...
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	desplesda		yeah
2005-02-24T11:46:00.000Z	ssamf	cyklus	ctrl alt left/right

2005-02-24T11:47:00.000Z	cyklus	ssamf	thanks :)
2005-02-24T11:47:00.000Z	ssamf		was anything you upgraded sound related?
2005-02-24T11:47:00.000Z	desplesda		gstreamer
2005-02-24T11:48:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	did you try what it says? "sudo apt-get -f install"
2005-02-24T11:48:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	bah... I should read...
2005-02-24T11:49:00.000Z	ssamf		can you revert gstreamer to the earlier version?
2005-02-24T11:49:00.000Z	NuuB		luniktik: yes i did - lol no prob
2005-02-24T11:49:00.000Z	lunitik		yeah... not much you can do enless you want to pull down the samba-common package from hoary?
2005-02-24T11:49:00.000Z	desplesda		how do i do that?
2005-02-24T11:49:00.000Z	lunitik	desplesda	I'm confused... what is your problem?
2005-02-24T11:50:00.000Z	desplesda		i just upgraded to the latest warty, and /dev/dsp has disappeared
2005-02-24T11:50:00.000Z	lunitik	desplesda	uhh... is the sound module loaded?
2005-02-24T11:50:00.000Z	senectus_		how do you format a partition?
2005-02-24T11:50:00.000Z	lunitik		lsmod | snd, lsmod | grep snd, blah... tired, senectus: try sudo cfdisk, fairly simple interface...
2005-02-24T11:51:00.000Z	desplesda		the sound module's loaded
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	can i just remove it? i have other installs more pressing to finish (apache and such) - i was getting non-stop samba complaints and tried installing samba fresh to shut them up but now it refuses to perform any other installs untill this samba error is resolved :-Z
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	lunitik	desplesda	hmm... there are no instances of /dev/dsp?  (ie /dev/dsp0)
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	desplesda		none, i hit /dev/d <TAB><TAB> and it gives me /dev/dvd
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	senectus_	lunitik	great, thanks
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	desplesda		bah, i've gotta go
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	its safe, sure... It'll remove ubuntu-desktop though, so you may want to think about that when you come to upgrade to hoary...
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	desplesda		thanks anyway
2005-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	crap. i dont want the whole blasted desktop removed
2005-02-24T11:54:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	nah... just the meta-package 'ubuntu-desktop' will be removed...
2005-02-24T11:55:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	It may cause issues when you upgrade to hoary though...
2005-02-24T11:55:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	i'm a novice, you say desktop, i hear whole-damn-GUI
2005-02-24T11:56:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	I tried to make that distinction but putting it in quotes  :P
2005-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	ssamf		it is just a meta package
2005-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		he just horribly failed :)
2005-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	lunitik	Tsjoklat	no one asked you, shush  :P
2005-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	ssamf		it contains nothing but depends on everything you need for a desktop
2005-02-24T11:57:00.000Z	NuuB		lol, "meta package" may have meaning to you, none to me unfortunately
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	ssamf		if you install ubuntu-desktop it will get all the other packages, but uninstalling it does nothing
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	NuuB	one of the reasons why this meta-package is useful is that it will make an upgrade to Hoary do things like automatically pull in xorg., right, uninstalling it deletes nothing., I often delete it when I switch from totem-gstreamer to totem-xine
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	ssamf		you can for example uninstall xchat, because it is depended on by ubuntu-desktop, unless you remove ubuntu-desktop
2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	well, no... thats the responsibility of 'x-window-system-core'  :P
2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	NuuB	MobyTurbo	xorg is one more thing with no meaning (not asking you to explain, just setting the bar lower so it is closer to my present level of knowledge)
2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	ah, another meta-package. :-)
2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	lunitik		*nods*
2005-02-24T12:00:00.000Z	ssamf		xorg is the replacement og xfree, which was the old graphics system
2005-02-24T12:01:00.000Z	NuuB		ok, can i uninstall samba (with it uninstalling the desktop), and then reinstall the desktop meta package?
2005-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	well... but it will reinstall samba-common when you do so...
2005-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	NuuB	no, reinstalling the desktop meta package will automatically pull in Samba
2005-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	ssamf		no, if you reinstall ubuntu-desktop, it will go "oh, you need samba for a complete desktop" and install it
2005-02-24T12:02:00.000Z	NuuB	ssamf	ok, xorg eq newer xfree - that i get
2005-02-24T12:03:00.000Z	ssamf		meta packages are good, because they let you install loads of stuff with one command
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	NuuB		i dont care right now if i have samba or not, i may care later, but right now i just want to finsh the installs i had been doing beforehand
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	ssamf		but if you dont need everything the want, then they are a bit of a pain
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	fiacca		ciao a tutti
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		bacamilli!
2005-02-24T12:04:00.000Z	ssamf		so you install the meta package, then remove the meta package, and you have everything, now you can remove stuff without restriction (well with less), but when it comes to upgrade to hoary, you will need to manually add ubuntu-desktop back, so that the new version will install new pieces of software
2005-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	Cam-		ssamf?
2005-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	ssamf		yes
2005-02-24T12:06:00.000Z	Cam-		what was that about?, sorry interested..
2005-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	ssamf		about meta packages, specifically the ubuntu-desktop one
2005-02-24T12:08:00.000Z	NuuB		i just tried to do a remove and it is still frozen
2005-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	lunitik	ssamf	apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop  <-- everything listed there is what it depends on... its the devels way of making sure everyones systems are fairly complete etc...
2005-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	Cam-		yep, sorry you just mentioned manual add of ubuntu-desktop back. im doing a dist-upgrade at the moment
2005-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	ssamf		or in synaptic right click on it and go to properties
2005-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	Cam-		so i was curious as to what you meant, ;-)
2005-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	lunitik	ssamf	usually, meta-packages are used at a lower level in Debian... example: 'gnome' 'gnome-core' and 'gnome-environment', 'x-window-system' and 'x-window-system-core'... 'kde-core' and 'kde... etc
2005-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	lunitik	Cam-	yeah... you want ubuntu-desktop around to make sure you are getting everything from hoary...
2005-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	Cam-		yep, ive done a clean install of warty, and dist-upgrading at the moment to hoary
2005-02-24T12:11:00.000Z	NuuB		is it possible there is something going on like a file lock that needs removing so i can continue doing my installs with apt-get?
2005-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	lunitik	Cam-	for instance... a bittorrent client is new to hoary... you wouldn't get that... update-monitor and update-notification are more examples of changes you might miss...
2005-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	it would tell you if there is..
2005-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	Cam-		yer my meta packages are intact
2005-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	if there is, make sure nothing like synaptic or apt-get etc are running.
2005-02-24T12:13:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	i have no idea how to do that
2005-02-24T12:13:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	ps -e is what I usually use... or ps aux.., ps aux is messy though imo
2005-02-24T12:14:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	on SysV ps does "-ef" and on BSD it's "aux". There are advantages of the -ef display.
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	Stormie`		anone here ?
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	topyli	lunitik	depends on what info you need. like process owners
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	Stormie`		anyone here ?
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	mebaran		could anyone help me with an Alsa Problem, ??????
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	synaptic: no and apt-get: no
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	Stormie`		anyone know , where to get usb modem software ?
2005-02-24T12:15:00.000Z	lunitik	topyli	I can see that with 'ps -e' .... ? are root... others are me... not useful when more people are logged in I guess  :/
2005-02-24T12:17:00.000Z	Stormie`		anyone know , where to get usb modem(Aztech) software ?
2005-02-24T12:17:00.000Z	topyli		hm
2005-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	lunitik	mebaran	perhaps if you ask the question?
2005-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	mebaran		oh, sorry, I was trying my own little tricks, no dice
2005-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	do you know if people actually have that modem working with linux?
2005-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	mebaran		I check all my mixer settings, and my modul;es
2005-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	NuuB		what is the prefered copy and paste website here?
2005-02-24T12:18:00.000Z	mebaran		but ALSA makes no sound no where
2005-02-24T12:19:00.000Z	topyli	NuuB	pastebin.com i guess. but you can use #flood just as well
2005-02-24T12:19:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	i dunno ... just wanna asking ..
2005-02-24T12:20:00.000Z	lunitik	mebaran	are you in 'sound' group?
2005-02-24T12:20:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	try googling for the modem model and linux
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	mebaran		I am in the audio group, do I ahve to join the sound group, the dsp and the mixer
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	lunitik	mebaran	yeah... thats what I meant  :)
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	mebaran		register themselves as part of the sound group
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	lunitik		did I mention I'm tired?
2005-02-24T12:21:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	owh , ok .. but i can detect the modem .. i just needed a software or program to work it
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	NuuB		ok, this is what i keep getting (minus the php tags the site inserted) http://pastebin.com/241330
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	lunitik		heh... tried 'cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp' ?
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	Neil3	mebaran	try this in the terminal
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	lunitik		should sound like static
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	Neil3		killall esd
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	Hwolf		My rhytmbox suddenly can't find all my music. All the artists are still there tho.
2005-02-24T12:22:00.000Z	Neil3		then try a program that uses alsa
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	if you're lucky you have all the drivers you need in the kernel. what you need to find out is which ones to load
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	mebaran		very very faint static
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	daniels	Keyb	screen on a remote host.  screen on a remote host, Keyb.
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	lunitik	Neil3	most apps in Ubuntu use esd... and you didn't even tell him to change media mechanism  :/
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	Neil3		esd sucks
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	Keyb	daniels	x doesn't work with screen, fix that, kthxbye
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	lunitik	Neil3	beats the heck out of raw alsa for most cards  :/
2005-02-24T12:23:00.000Z	Neil3		yeah you have to run gstreamer-properties and set the stuff in there to alsa too
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	daniels	Keybuk	irssi(1)
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	Keybuk	daniels	irssi != x-chat
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	Neil3		it gave me latency issues with dvds and movies, the sound would lag behind the video by half a second or so
2005-02-24T12:24:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	so any solution ... ?
2005-02-24T12:25:00.000Z	mebaran		so any ideas, ok dsp seems shot then
2005-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	NuuB		btw, is cursing permitted in here? i'm holding back a salty sailor cause of this error
2005-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	no fucking clue
2005-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	search the web and you'll find out what modules people are using. or then you'll find it doesn't work for anyone. or you'll find workarounds and hacks to force it to work
2005-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	Neil3		haha
2005-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	NuuB		good
2005-02-24T12:26:00.000Z	Neil3	NuuB	i think we have freedom of speech
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	topyli		yeah. "Longhorn!"
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	NuuB		maybe, but many irc channels are a far cry from a democracy
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	just don't get immature with it... else people will look down on it...
2005-02-24T12:27:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	ubuntu has any hacks ?
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	lunitik	Stormie`	what do you mean 'hacks'?
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	just kernel modules. but some usb modems are windows only, so you have to convince the modem that's what you have :)
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	i just want to overcome this fucking error and get on with my life
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	Neil3		on a side note i've found gstreamer to work well using oss
2005-02-24T12:28:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	just remove samba... then bring it back later...
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	owh ... ok, going to find out some hard problem going arround
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	i tried "sudo apt-get remove samba" and am STILL getting the error
2005-02-24T12:29:00.000Z	Stormie`	lunitik	i don't mean anything ..
2005-02-24T12:30:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	no, you may find something simple like "load modules foo, bar, and baz and it should work", or you may find some really scary hacks, in which case you might as well enter the modem market
2005-02-24T12:31:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	what did 'sudo apt-get -f install' say?
2005-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	when i go to device manager, and i found my modem listed there
2005-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	but i can't connect with tat
2005-02-24T12:32:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	and my modem doesnt have any signal too
2005-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	you need to load modules (drivers) for it. then you still need to setup networking to use it for the interface
2005-02-24T12:33:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	just figuring tat , cd had a problem or anything , or i had did anything wrong, owh ok ..
2005-02-24T12:34:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	so where to get the modules ( drivers
2005-02-24T12:34:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	so where to get the modules ( drivers )
2005-02-24T12:34:00.000Z	topyli	Stormie`	not difficult, when you know _which_ modules you need. this you need to find out by searching the web
2005-02-24T12:34:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	it said this: http://pastebin.com/241336
2005-02-24T12:34:00.000Z	Stormie`	topyli	i will be back later, going to eat
2005-02-24T12:36:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	'invoke-rc.d: dangling symlink: /etc/rc2.d/K09samba' seems to be the error... check that out... ls -l and see where its pointing...

2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	lunitik	brain_	no, although it will automagically
2005-02-24T12:41:00.000Z	brain_	lunitik	damn... im suffering in dialup
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	lunitik		it checks /var/cache/apt/archive/partial ...
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	brain_		i've been disconnected in 97%, so theres no possible way?
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	lunitik	brain_	I just said... it does it automatically.
2005-02-24T12:42:00.000Z	brain_	lunitik	thanks!, so hows life here? i've been using ubuntu for 2days
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	lunitik	brain_	not bad... cool you chose Ubuntu though  :)
2005-02-24T12:43:00.000Z	narkceh		i have only 2gb hard disk :(, and im afraid that it wont work
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	brain_	lunitik	is the /var/cache/apt/archives is the deb packages downloaded by the apt-get ?
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	narkceh		im installing it all the time though and not had any problems yet
2005-02-24T12:44:00.000Z	lunitik	brain_	yes
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	brain_		ok so i can use it for the other pc. alright thanks for the info lunitik, going for dinner.. brb.. thanks lunitik!
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	lunitik	brain_	may want to look into apt-proxy to do that.
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	brain_		ok, later dude. thanks going for dinner
2005-02-24T12:45:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	what am i diong wrong here? "sudo ln -s /etc/rc2.d/K09samba /etc/init.d/samba"
2005-02-24T12:46:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	so do you think that ubuntu wont work on 2gb hard disk?
2005-02-24T12:46:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	source and destination is wrong way around... and the destination can't exist prior to command..., (so remove it...)
2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	acs		hello
2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	you should be fine... although you won't have much room for other stuff...
2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	narkceh		hehe
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	destination of /etc/init.d/samba cannot exist before hand?
2005-02-24T12:48:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	no... K09samba can't exist
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	'ln -s /etc/init.d/samba /etc/rc2.d/K09samba' after removing the latter...
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	it doesn't, i removed it already
2005-02-24T12:49:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	so i will have like 1bit hard disk space left.
2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	no... like 300 megs...
2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	ok, that did it
2005-02-24T12:50:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	yeah thanks :)

2005-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	funny how apt tells you how to fix what is wrong usually   :)
2005-02-24T12:54:00.000Z	Tomcat_		In the future maybe it can do that itself :P
2005-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	yeah, helps when you *understand* what its trying to tell you too ;-P
2005-02-24T12:55:00.000Z	lunitik	Tomcat_	would be cool... prod mdz about it  :P
2005-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	lunitik	Tomcat_	although that would definatly have to be able to be turned off... would get much complaints otherwise  :)
2005-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	true enough  :)
2005-02-24T12:56:00.000Z	NuuB		scaper?

2005-02-24T01:00:00.000Z	vixus		then just /etc/init.d/gdm start, right?
2005-02-24T01:00:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	Seveas	they ALWAYS are

2005-02-24T01:07:00.000Z	lunitik	cyklus	working here   :/
2005-02-24T01:07:00.000Z	cyklus	lunitik	you compile mplayer yourself?
2005-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		anyone?
2005-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	xskoulax		sorry
2005-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	lunitik	cyklus	nope... installed from multiverse  :/
2005-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	cyklus	lunitik	ic
2005-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	lunitik	LucaBrasi	apt-get install xorg-common xserver-xorg
2005-02-24T01:09:00.000Z	vixus		so.., ill do that later, can anyone help me get bluez working?
2005-02-24T01:09:00.000Z	LucaBrasi	lunitik	errrrr .. wtf .. isn't xserver etc installed by default with hoary?
2005-02-24T01:10:00.000Z	lunitik	cyklus	but you typed 'mplayer -vo help' and its not listed?
2005-02-24T01:10:00.000Z	lunitik	cyklus	but you typed 'mplayer -ao help' and its not listed?, blah, bet you it is  :/
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		yo can someone explain whats going on ..why's hoary not booting into gnome by default?
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	since i ran the "sudo apt-get remove samba" command, do i need to reinstall the desktop? (i am trying to complete the samba install right now)
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	lunitik	LucaBrasi	should be... but sometimes isn't....
2005-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	don't worry about that until you are about to install hoary...
2005-02-24T01:12:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		should be but sometimes isn't  ???? wtf
2005-02-24T01:12:00.000Z	lunitik	LucaBrasi	its more a first course of action though... did you do it?
2005-02-24T01:12:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		dude I have to reboot to 'try it', so I dont wanna reboot unless that's really it
2005-02-24T01:12:00.000Z	lunitik	LucaBrasi	uhh... no you don't  :/
2005-02-24T01:12:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		um i'm dual booting, yes I do
2005-02-24T01:12:00.000Z	lunitik	LucaBrasi	ctrl alt f1 and log in   :/, blah... then get on it  :)
2005-02-24T01:13:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		but why???
2005-02-24T01:13:00.000Z	lunitik	LucaBrasi	because thats probably the issue?
2005-02-24T01:13:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		why would I need to install this shit separately .. I thought that's part of the basic install?
2005-02-24T01:13:00.000Z	cyklus	lunitik	i needed another library when i compiled mplayer to enable esd... im recompiling now
2005-02-24T01:13:00.000Z	lunitik		else 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'...
2005-02-24T01:13:00.000Z	cyklus	lunitik	thank you :)
2005-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		why would anyone want perfumed tampons
2005-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	spiral		hi
2005-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		ubuntu can kiss my ass, I'm installing suse
2005-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	lunitik	Tsjoklat	wow... random  :)   haha... I think I get in trouble again for answering though?
2005-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	LucaBrasi		what a joke of a distro if you have to install x separately
2005-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	hmm, ok well i've stripped and reinstalled this system several times, and expect i shall again (and gone through several *nixes)
2005-02-24T01:15:00.000Z	topyli	LucaBrasi	indeed. which distro is that?
2005-02-24T01:15:00.000Z	lunitik	topyli	he is having x issues from warty to hoary... told him to make sure xserver-xorg and xorg-common are installed... he freaked  :/
2005-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		no happy customer
2005-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	topyli	lunitik	oh. well, suse it is then
2005-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	vixus		I'm trying to add DVD support, but libdvdcss2 (as listed on ubnutuguide) doesn't exist.
2005-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	lunitik	topyli	pretty much my thoughts exactly...  :)
2005-02-24T01:17:00.000Z	cyklus	vixus	add this to apt sources "deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main"
2005-02-24T01:17:00.000Z	topyli	lunitik	no hoary there to lure newbies from the path
2005-02-24T01:17:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		the path to darkness?
2005-02-24T01:18:00.000Z	topyli		tha path to console :D
2005-02-24T01:18:00.000Z	lunitik	topyli	there was an article about upgrading to hoary... I think thats the reason for a lot of these issues  :(
2005-02-24T01:18:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		I am just trying to find the path in between menstrual pads here
2005-02-24T01:19:00.000Z	lunitik	Tsjoklat	#1 reason I am happy to have a penis  :P, well... maybe a close second? idk
2005-02-24T01:20:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		dunno lunitik.. it tends to get in the ... way?
2005-02-24T01:20:00.000Z	topyli	lunitik	doesn't save us from much :)
2005-02-24T01:20:00.000Z	lunitik	Tsjoklat	nah... just train junior and its never an issue  :P
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		ah well.. not many trained juniors out there then :)
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	lunitik		guess not?  8)
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	vixus	cyklus	Installed! Any further configging I need to do?
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		we need to clone you lunitik
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	topyli		me and junior have been in training for years. we're pretty well tamed now
2005-02-24T01:21:00.000Z	lunitik	Tsjoklat	no no... I'm already not unique enough  :(
2005-02-24T01:22:00.000Z	cyklus	vixus	nope should work if you got a player, like mplayer or xine :P
2005-02-24T01:22:00.000Z	lunitik		Every time I go out, I am told I remind someone of someone  :(
2005-02-24T01:22:00.000Z	zzyber		im stuck. I get "could not initialize graphics system Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw" when i try to run games from a windows emulator. I have xorg and ati fglrx driver
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	lunitik	zzyber	yeah... DirectDraw isn't implemented well in Wine...
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	NuuB		linitik & Tsjoklat: well there IS a song called "Detatchable Penis"
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	vixus	cyklus	Totem will do?
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	lunitik	zzyber	maybe try transgaming's cedega?
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	NuuB	sounds like something we need to get!
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	zzyber	lunitik	but i have tried cedega, crossover office and wine. Same on all
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	I'd lose him though... thats no good  :(
2005-02-24T01:23:00.000Z	zzyber	lunitik	could it be my fglrx driver?
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	lunitik	zzyber	no idea... sorry
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	lol yeah, that happens to the guy in the song
2005-02-24T01:24:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	that would just be scary  :(
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	NuuB		he finds it laying on a blanket being sold by a street vendor
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	cyklus	vixus	should
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	vixus		ok
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	maybe, but makes for a very funny song lol
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	vixus	cyklus	Got xine anyway
2005-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		I love the rodeo song
2005-02-24T01:26:00.000Z	lunitik	Tsjoklat	rodeo song? never heard of it
2005-02-24T01:27:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		love it.. pretty blunt though, I doubt I can paste any of the lyrics in here :)
2005-02-24T01:27:00.000Z	topyli	NuuB	that must be a primus song
2005-02-24T01:27:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		it is not suitable for sensitive souls
2005-02-24T01:28:00.000Z	vixus	cyklus	How do I update the app menu to show the new things I've installed (Xine etc)?
2005-02-24T01:28:00.000Z	NuuB	topyli	no clue, trying to find it now (since i was reminded of it and mentioned it)
2005-02-24T01:28:00.000Z	topyli	NuuB	i just found it and it's primus all right, it _could_ only possbly be primus or zappa really
2005-02-24T01:29:00.000Z	NuuB		full mp3?
2005-02-24T01:30:00.000Z	topyli		yeah, i've had it here for a good while
2005-02-24T01:31:00.000Z	vixus		How do I update the app menu?
2005-02-24T01:31:00.000Z	NuuB	topyli	if you say so, only people in the history of the world to pick up an instrument and blank song sheet who had a sense of humor ;-P
2005-02-24T01:32:00.000Z	vixus	cyklus	"Totem doesn't have the necessary plugins."
2005-02-24T01:33:00.000Z	Tsjoklat	lunitik	http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/gary_lee_and_the_showdown/the_rodeo_song.html
2005-02-24T01:33:00.000Z	topyli	NuuB	don't forget modern talking! i'd say they must have some sense of humor. or irony at least :)
2005-02-24T01:33:00.000Z	NuuB		too bad i opted for no sound board on this machine, i'll have to find i from my other sometime (my first search came up with squat)
2005-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	topyli	vixus	not all apps put the icons there, you may have to add it yourself
2005-02-24T01:34:00.000Z	vixus		ok, anyway, neither xine nor totem updated to accomodate libdvdcss2. Should I update?, *reboot, not update. XD, :|
2005-02-24T01:35:00.000Z	topyli	vixus	see what you have in ~/.gnome2/totem-addons
2005-02-24T01:37:00.000Z	vixus		Nothing at all.
2005-02-24T01:41:00.000Z	snowblink		hi - can anyone see the new Star Wars trailer _with_ sound?
2005-02-24T01:42:00.000Z	Hwolf		Is it me, or is gnome getting more sluggish by the minute?
2005-02-24T01:43:00.000Z	vixus		topyli?
2005-02-24T01:44:00.000Z	LM_ex		does it work?
2005-02-24T01:45:00.000Z	El_Che		is there a way to edit the applications menu in hoary?
2005-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	marcin_ant		hi I got a problem with dvd..., could someone help me and tell how to use dvd device on /dev/hdb, mounted as /dev/cdrom1, how to use this device with mplayer?, I have libdvdcss2 installed
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	NuuB		apt-get is saying: "0 upgraded, 7 newly installed, 0 to remove and 99 not upgraded." - is the 99 not upgraded suggesting that i take some action?
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-02-24T01:53:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	going to hoary>, ?*
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	topyli	El_Che	by right clicking the menu items themselves, or via nautilus (go to applications:/// )
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	lunitik	topyli	he said in hoary.
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	El_Che	topyli	works in warty like that, not in hoary
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	topyli		ah, sorry
2005-02-24T01:54:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	no, dont want to go to hoary, want to stick with warty, as i understand it warty is still the release version
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	El_Che		probably temporarely disabled
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	topyli		or broken
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	yes... but thats a lot of packages that need to be upgraded... blah... dist-upgrade will fix issue
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	El_Che	topyli	some URIS work, applications: dont
2005-02-24T01:55:00.000Z	lunitik	El_Che	nah... they are working on a different mechanism... but its taking a long time  :/
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	El_Che		ic
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	then the "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" is to perform an upgrade to hoary?
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	no...
2005-02-24T01:56:00.000Z	ZolMed		has anyone managed to get CD printing working in Linux on a Canon i965, or any Canon printer for that matter?
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	lunitik		dist-upgrade just updates things that change something... ie different depends... different config layout etc...
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	same as Synaptic's 'smart' mechanism...
2005-02-24T01:57:00.000Z	mz2		my cursor theme is all messed up after an update
2005-02-24T01:58:00.000Z	lunitik	mz2	black now? white is coming back in a different package apparently...
2005-02-24T01:58:00.000Z	mz2		oh i see
2005-02-24T01:58:00.000Z	lunitik		another hoary user  :)
2005-02-24T01:59:00.000Z	El_Che	mz2	try gcursor
2005-02-24T01:59:00.000Z	El_Che	mz2	nice transparent cursor
2005-02-24T01:59:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	again, "synaptic" is not familiar to me (remember, set the bar low for my present level of knowledge - the whole point of my getting ubuntu is to start learning this stuff)
2005-02-24T02:00:00.000Z	mz2		i actually tried already
2005-02-24T02:00:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	synaptic is the 'easy' way to use apt...
2005-02-24T02:00:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	gui frontend... Computer > System Configuration > Synaptic Package Manager
2005-02-24T02:00:00.000Z	El_Che	mz2	you selected an other cursor there?
2005-02-24T02:00:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	if you say so lol
2005-02-24T02:01:00.000Z	mz2		should it be updated on this same login time?, or another?
2005-02-24T02:01:00.000Z	El_Che		an other, log out, log in
2005-02-24T02:01:00.000Z	mz2		got it :)
2005-02-24T02:02:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	ah, well in that case, i'll stick with the cli - i need the gui, but only as much as to let me be functional while learning to do stuff in the cli
2005-02-24T02:02:00.000Z	Xappe		i downloaded a new cursor theme and changed the x-cursor to that one...now I have a nice cursor even in gdm
2005-02-24T02:03:00.000Z	El_Che	Xappe	gcursor has the only true transparent (semi otherwise useless) cursor i have ever seen :)
2005-02-24T02:03:00.000Z	Xappe		lunitic, well it's all about beauty
2005-02-24T02:03:00.000Z	ogra	El_Che	you mean the whiteglass cursor ?
2005-02-24T02:04:00.000Z	lunitik	ogra	hey ogra  :)
2005-02-24T02:04:00.000Z	ogra	El_Che	that one comes with X (was there since X 4.2 but hidden) gcursor only makes it visible to you ;)
2005-02-24T02:04:00.000Z	ogra	lunitik	hi
2005-02-24T02:05:00.000Z	El_Che	ogra	I see
2005-02-24T02:05:00.000Z	lunitik	Xappe	seriously though... I usually look at where I'm clicking, not the cursor itself... I guess thats just me though?
2005-02-24T02:05:00.000Z	El_Che	ogra	idd whiteglass
2005-02-24T02:05:00.000Z	lunitik		idd?
2005-02-24T02:05:00.000Z	ogra	mz2	if you want your old cursor back, install the jimmac cursor theme in gcursor and select it :)
2005-02-24T02:05:00.000Z	El_Che	lunitik	InDeeD
2005-02-24T02:06:00.000Z	Xappe		i installed jimmac systemwide instead..., feels better somehow
2005-02-24T02:07:00.000Z	narkceh		how to change mouse settings?
2005-02-24T02:08:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	Computer > Preferences > Mouse
2005-02-24T02:08:00.000Z	El_Che		any idea when the full gnome translation will enter the hoary packages? Most are finished upstream while the ones in ubuntu are frankenstein :)
2005-02-24T02:08:00.000Z	Xappe	lunitik	well that wrist watch IS ugly, and i usually play around with the cursor while watching progress bars... :)
2005-02-24T02:08:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	but in console?
2005-02-24T02:09:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	little more complicated... whats wrong?
2005-02-24T02:10:00.000Z	narkceh		the mouse wont work
2005-02-24T02:10:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	umm... you booted into Linux right now?
2005-02-24T02:10:00.000Z	narkceh		and i dont know how to change it with keyboard, yes im in the grafical thing
2005-02-24T02:11:00.000Z	fsc		anybody familiar with python and would know why i would get a ./setup.py, from: can't read /var/mail/distutils.core, i installed python2.4-setuptools
2005-02-24T02:11:00.000Z	lunitik		alt f1 > go to start terminal
2005-02-24T02:11:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	^
2005-02-24T02:11:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	usb or ps mouse?
2005-02-24T02:11:00.000Z	narkceh		its a old ps mouse
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	mz2		it still isn't what it's supposed to be
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	ok... lsmod | grep psmouse for me, is it there?
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	mz2		it's this black ugly thing. and not even the default X11 black ugly thing :)
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	narkceh		how to get root?
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	sudo -s
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	narkceh		thnaks
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	shouldn't need it for that
2005-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	narkceh	no nee for root, s/nee/need/
2005-02-24T02:13:00.000Z	narkceh		okey, ill try lsmod
2005-02-24T02:13:00.000Z	lunitik	ogra	sudo is still root... :/
2005-02-24T02:13:00.000Z	ogra		nah
2005-02-24T02:13:00.000Z	lunitik		root permissions aren't root?
2005-02-24T02:13:00.000Z	ogra	lunitik	sudo is uid 0
2005-02-24T02:14:00.000Z	lunitik		sudo -l even brings roots stuff over  :/
2005-02-24T02:14:00.000Z	ogra	lunitik	sudo logs everything you do ... for example....
2005-02-24T02:14:00.000Z	lunitik	ogra	so does regular root... in .history  :/
2005-02-24T02:14:00.000Z	ogra	lunitik	sudo offers you fine grained access rights to administrative tasks....
2005-02-24T02:14:00.000Z	deepsight		hmmm im compiling my kernel and i get a vfs: unable to mount root fs on ...  do you know what is probably missing in my configuration? my machine is a compaq armada m700...
2005-02-24T02:15:00.000Z	El_Che		if you like the good old debian's root: sudo passwd root
2005-02-24T02:15:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	why do you recompile `
2005-02-24T02:15:00.000Z	narkceh		damn this takes 1000h because my 200mhz comp is slow
2005-02-24T02:16:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	you probably should really be using a different GUI than GNOME on a 200MHz computer.
2005-02-24T02:16:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	long story... trying to install vmware but it complained about the C headers so i downloaded them and then it told me that they were different from my current kernel, that i had to recompile
2005-02-24T02:16:00.000Z	El_Che	narkceh	try xfce
2005-02-24T02:16:00.000Z	deepsight		im just following Mr Vmware orders
2005-02-24T02:16:00.000Z	vixus		Hello., I want to network my Windows 98 PC to this Ubuntu box, for the sake of transferring my music., Possible?
2005-02-24T02:16:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	yes
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	look into samba
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	vixus		Ok., By the way. The windows 98 pc is on the network wirelessly.
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	there is a headers package for every ubuntu linux-image, you souldnt recompile the kernel just to get a vmware module
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	narkceh	MobyTurbo	yeah but how to change it?
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	vixus		Is that a problem lunitik?
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	no
2005-02-24T02:17:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	install it using aptitude, apt-get, or synaptic, then hopefully you can run it from gdm.
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	i know i downloaded the correct one i think but it still complained... dont have the exact error now
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	Is there a guide on setting up? It's just, I've sucked at setting up Samba.
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	narkceh		apt-get install xfce?
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	what will happen when i do "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" ? (i am wondering if it will initiate some massive d/l over my lil'56k serial modem)
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	deepsight		can't i just get the default .config from somewhere?, and compile with that?
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	then you didnt download the correct ones
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	there are many... I can answer some questions... but I'm not gonna tell you how to do it... would take too long
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	narkceh	MobyTurbo	apt-get install xfce?
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	sure. Though if xfce is still to slow, try fluxbox.
2005-02-24T02:18:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	do you use the linux-source package for your kernel to compile ?
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	deepsight		yes
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	lunitik	NuuB	yes... those 99 packages held back will be downloaded and installed
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	vixus		Ok. Well, I'm following the samba server setup guide on ubuntuguide.org
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	then you can use the config that is stored in /boot
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	no... apt-get install xfce4
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	mz2		the default cursor theme in gcursor just looks like that error image ("!")
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	apt-get install samba/smbfs... done!
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	else you get xfce, which was ugly...
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	narkceh	MobyTurbo	but i need to delete gnome because of my low hard disk space. so i need to delete gnome first?
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	mz2		so what package do i need to install to get it back?
2005-02-24T02:19:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	ok xfce4 then, how to remove gnome?
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	NuuB	lunitik	any way to know ahead of time how big a download it will entail?
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	with other sources you will miss a lot of ubuntu specific patches.... dunno if the ubuntu .config works then
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	deepsight		so i have several config-2.6.8.1-3-386 is the one that works right now
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	narkceh		apt-get remove gnome?
2005-02-24T02:20:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	so if im ok with this config i just recompile it with this one and it should work theoretically?
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	lunitik		xfce = ver. 3  .... the reason it stands for XForms Cool Environment ... XForms was an ugly toolkit though
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	but there are a lot of people using vmware in ubuntu taht didnt recompile their kernel ;)
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		xfce uses gtk now
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	damn those ppl
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	if you give the right options to make-kpkg ....
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	I think I've done the linux side of things, how do I do the Windows side?
2005-02-24T02:21:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	yes... but this is the reason there are still 2 packages... xfce = xforms ; xfce4 = gtk2
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	just share stuff  :/
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	OK
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	i followed the Wiki tutorial in ubuntu webpage...
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	but ill try again with the headers
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	What do you mean just share stuff?
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	deepsight		let me give you the error
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	I actually like lyx's xforms version more than their Qt version, but I agree with you about xfce v3
2005-02-24T02:22:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	right click 'share'
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	vixus		On windows or linux?, I want to make [windows]  stuff available to [linux] 
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	so i use: apt-get install xfce4?
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	vixus		yes narkcehg
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	you asked how to configure the windows side... which do you think?
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	vixus		=D, Sorry.
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	yes
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	vixus		OK...
2005-02-24T02:23:00.000Z	narkceh		ok thanks both
2005-02-24T02:24:00.000Z	cyklus		can anyone paste me their totem config... totem keeps crashing when i try to run it becuase it cant find alsa.. i need to set it to esd.. but i hae no config file yet, ?
2005-02-24T02:24:00.000Z	deepsight		There is probably a slight difference in the kernel configuration between the, set of C header files you specified and your running kernel.  You may want to, rebuild a kernel based on that directory, or specify another directory.
2005-02-24T02:24:00.000Z	narkceh		E: Cannot Find The pagage
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	There is no option 'share'...
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	deepsight		Unable to make a vmmon module that can be loaded in the running kernel:, insmod: error inserting '/tmp/vmware-config0/vmmon.o': -1 Unknown symbol in module
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	narkceh		how to install xfce4 if i cant install it because it wont find it?
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	you need to enable universe
2005-02-24T02:25:00.000Z	narkceh		and how to do that?
2005-02-24T02:26:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	uncomment the line in /etc/apt/sources.list, ie get rid of the #
2005-02-24T02:27:00.000Z	thesilverhand	narkceh	or read howto install xfce4.2 on ubuntu forums to get latest version instead
2005-02-24T02:27:00.000Z	cyklus		anyone know how to get totem to work on hoary?
2005-02-24T02:27:00.000Z	narkceh		all the #?
2005-02-24T02:27:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	uhh... there should be... like 4th down... only entry in second section of the menu  (after first seperator do-hicky)
2005-02-24T02:28:00.000Z	thesilverhand	narkceh	just lines beginning with deb or deb-src that state universe
2005-02-24T02:28:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	no... just the one with 'universe' in the line
2005-02-24T02:28:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	what thesilverhand said... cept you don't want deb-src prolly, just makes it take longer to update  :/
2005-02-24T02:28:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	your linux-image and linux-headers package have matching version numbers ?
2005-02-24T02:28:00.000Z	thesilverhand		true
2005-02-24T02:29:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	ok
2005-02-24T02:29:00.000Z	netmonk		greetings, ogra :)
2005-02-24T02:29:00.000Z	ogra		hey netmonk
2005-02-24T02:29:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	yes... i think i found a wiki about vmware
2005-02-24T02:29:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	i tell you if it works
2005-02-24T02:30:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		actually for Ubuntu adding deb-src is a one-time slowdown, since universe isn't being updated.
2005-02-24T02:30:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	you could update the information in the ubuntu wiki ;)
2005-02-24T02:30:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	s/ubuntu/warty and I will agree
2005-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	well, I wouldn't reccomend that a newbie run hoary quite yet.
2005-02-24T02:31:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	true... but else its a false statement  :/, even though I make enough of my own  :o
2005-02-24T02:32:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	it didnt work, maybe because i have a mess mixing all the kernels... so now ho i uninstall the other kernels.. bahh i just RTFM
2005-02-24T02:32:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		OK, a one-time increase in time for warty.
2005-02-24T02:33:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	just uninstall the packages you dont need ;)
2005-02-24T02:33:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	plus it still 'Hit''s :/   (ie, checks that nothing changed)
2005-02-24T02:34:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	the hits are very fast. I'm on a 56K modem and they last a fraction of a second.
2005-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	blah... why even have them if you don't intend to compile anything in the archive?
2005-02-24T02:35:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	most don't even use it anyways... they go get the tar.gz etc...
2005-02-24T02:36:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	yei, uninstalling 2 kernels now
2005-02-24T02:36:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	because if something is broken you might be able to fix it.
2005-02-24T02:36:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	a nebie?, newbie*
2005-02-24T02:36:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	sometimes a fix might be a one-line change that could be communicated even to a newbie.
2005-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	lunitik		Most have no idea about it...
2005-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	is you nick for female ogre in spanish?
2005-02-24T02:37:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	I never was of the opinion that one must dumb things down because of people who allegedly can't learn.
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	nope, lol, its only an abbreviation of my name
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	oh well it means that ;)
2005-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	Oliver Grawert ;)
2005-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	nice to meet you, Jose Garduno here
2005-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	hi :)
2005-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	eh... then uncomment when its needed?  (thats what I do) ... no point them being active... only actives I have are the main and resticted repos  :/
2005-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	so im going to reboot maybe some reboot magic helps
2005-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	your choice.
2005-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	deepsight		the reboot fairy
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	pretty logical too... why do I want everything coming down for an upgrade?
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	ogra	deepsight	kernel wise its not a fairy ;)
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	I run Warty so that doesn't ever happen here.
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	if it did it would take 10 minutes.
2005-02-24T02:40:00.000Z	narkceh		how to start xfc4?, i installed it
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	deepsight	ogra	dont ruin my fantasies... i just learned that santa claus doesnt exists
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	log out, and select it from a menu in gdm.
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	ogra		lol
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	blah... I never ran warty for more than a day after it was released   :/
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	deepsight		so i come
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	narkceh	MobyTurbo	ok, thanks
2005-02-24T02:41:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	running hoary with a 56K modem is impractical...
2005-02-24T02:42:00.000Z	bdale	lunitik	define 'involved'?
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	lunitik	bdale	working on... seperate from Debian  ;), ps... holy shit, you talked  :P
2005-02-24T02:43:00.000Z	bdale	lunitik	not really.  I'm running warty on one of my amd64 systems at home, that's mostly it
2005-02-24T02:44:00.000Z	lunitik	bdale	cool  :)
2005-02-24T02:46:00.000Z	El_Che	lunitik	you a bdale groupie? :)

2005-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	narkceh		when i write lsmod | grep psmouse
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	rem_		warty
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	ok... cat /dev/input/mouse0  <-- do that, move mouse... ctrl c to stop it...
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	netmonk		hm...
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	rem_		shouldnt there be a /dev/sda1 like in debian or even mdk/rh ..=, ?
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	rem_	I think it's created on the fly
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	'reset' if you get goofy charactors after...
2005-02-24T02:51:00.000Z	rem_		tahts right .., but it didnt with ubuntu .. ?:(
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	netmonk	rem_	when I was on warty I opened my usb flash on /dev/sda1
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	type it, don't do it...
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	rem_		ok thx
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	narkceh		"cat /dev/input/mouse0"?
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	yes
2005-02-24T02:52:00.000Z	netmonk	rem_	but my wifes usb flash was always mounted on /dev/uba or something like this
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	rem_		didnt find any uba..or like it ..
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	lunitik		Then move the mouse... should get output on the screen... telling you it is actually working
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	narkceh		lut says that file doesnt exitst
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	netmonk	rem_	is hotplug working?
2005-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	it says that there isnt that kind of file or directory, need root?
2005-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	rem_		oh ...i just remember something my usb scanner stopped working yesterday after a powershortage, although my pc stayed on (ups), and the scanner takes power from usb(?!) ..but that might be the reason...!
2005-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	narkceh		nope it wont work on that way either
2005-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	bah... for some reason, seems you need 'sudo cat /dev/input/mouse0'...
2005-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	rem_		..its prbably my usb not working properly ..
2005-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	might get same error though  :/
2005-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	in which case... I don't know how to get it back  :(
2005-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	narkceh		yes i got the same error
2005-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	netmonk	rem_	sorry
2005-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	rem_		thx anyway :D
2005-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	narkceh		so there isnt any autoconf thing like in debian setup?
2005-02-24T02:55:00.000Z	lunitik	bdale	you're a genius... he needs to add a device for his mouse... /dev/input/mouse0 is gone... you know how off hand?  :)
2005-02-24T02:56:00.000Z	narkceh		i think my mouse is in ps/2
2005-02-24T02:56:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	hence pointing you at that file  :/
2005-02-24T02:56:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	then it should be /dev/psaux
2005-02-24T02:57:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	no... thats Linux 2.4  :/
2005-02-24T02:57:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	I have it here, even with a USB mouse.
2005-02-24T02:57:00.000Z	lunitik		eh... actually... both work here...  :/
2005-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	it's probably on my system because I have a PS/2 port for a mouse, albeit one that's unused.
2005-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	narkceh		. /dev/psaux/mouse0?
2005-02-24T02:58:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	no
2005-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	no, just /dev/psaux
2005-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	'sudo cat /dev/psaux'
2005-02-24T02:59:00.000Z	narkceh		"cat /dev/psaux"?
2005-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	blah... just making sure its working elsewhere  :P
2005-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	j/k
2005-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	narkceh		so it should work now?
2005-02-24T03:00:00.000Z	lunitik	bdale	ahh... I get 'permission denied' here... even with sudo  :(
2005-02-24T03:01:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	mm... we are seeing if it works... next is letting X know about it...
2005-02-24T03:01:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	you got garble on the screen though?
2005-02-24T03:01:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	if your terminal gets messed up by the garbage, type "reset"
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	narkceh		i dint get anything when i wrote "cat /dev/psaux
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	Pointwood		/dev/hdc1 shouldn't that be root (hd1,0) in Grub? I have hda1 as (hd0,1)
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	did you move the mouse yet?
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	narkceh		nope?
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	lunitik		do it
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	narkceh		write reset?
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	lunitik		no, move mouse
2005-02-24T03:02:00.000Z	narkceh		it doesnt move anywhere
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	lunitik		do you get output on screen due to it though? (in the terminal)?
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	narkceh		when i write cat /dev/psaux it says nothing, a row where is nothing
2005-02-24T03:03:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	thats strange
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	narkceh		how to shut down gnome
2005-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	/etc/init.d/gdm stop
2005-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	narkceh		then ill write cat /dev/psaux and startx
2005-02-24T03:05:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	ok... should be no difference though
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	narkceh		or ill remove gde and use fxe4
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	would be faster to just hit ctrl+alt+f1
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	narkceh		ill remove gnome, and use xfc4
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	lunitik		idgi
2005-02-24T03:06:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	its not the GUI's fault... its X's.
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	you might want to get your mouse working before you switch window managers, GNOME doesn't deal with the mouse - X does.
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	huh?
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	lunitik		well... I'm guessing its X's... definatly not GNOME's though
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	Linux has multiple layers in it's graphical environment.
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	narkceh		i know but gnome is gay for my 200mhz machine
2005-02-24T03:07:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		s/it's/its
2005-02-24T03:08:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	agreed
2005-02-24T03:08:00.000Z	narkceh		yeah
2005-02-24T03:08:00.000Z	linuxboy		if I right click on the clock in ubuntu. Then click on  Adjust Date & Time. Then click on Sync with clocks on the net, it says 'Please run NTP support in the system to enable synchronisation of your local time server with internet time servers'. What must I do to fix this?
2005-02-24T03:08:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	have you ever thought of running Debian Sarge instead for that machine? You say it's low on diskspace and aren't going to be using GNOME anyway so running a minimal distro might be the thing for you.
2005-02-24T03:08:00.000Z	lunitik	linuxboy	apt-get install ntp
2005-02-24T03:09:00.000Z	lunitik	linuxboy	or ntp-server, I think that -server, yes... 'apt-get install ntp-server'...
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	newbietoubuntu		I am new to Ubuntu Linux.  I can't get my mp3's or mpg's to play.  I have succesfully copied them across from my windows machines.  Totem and Music player both gives failed to open:reason unknown.  Anyone give me some advice?
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	you could just have him use custom... same thing  :/
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	lunitik	MobyTurbo	cept this way... you don't have to tell him where to find files etc... he already has them
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	lunitik	true. But in that case he's reinstalling anyway.
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	bob2	newbietoubuntu	er, read the FAQ
2005-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	bob2	newbietoubuntu	wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-02-24T03:14:00.000Z	snowblink	newbietoubuntu	http://ubuntuguide.org/#codecs
2005-02-24T03:14:00.000Z	newbietoubuntu		thanks all for your help
2005-02-24T03:15:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	is "cat /dev/psaux" the command that i should use right?
2005-02-24T03:15:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	sudo that yes
2005-02-24T03:16:00.000Z	BGenesis	lunitik	Win 98 simply won't let me share, even after I checked Allow File Sharing in Control Panel > Network.
2005-02-24T03:17:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	it doesnt work. ill just throw the computer out of the window and buy a comp where is usb mouse compatible
2005-02-24T03:17:00.000Z	lunitik	BGenesis	bah... add 'FIle and Print services' in the same place...
2005-02-24T03:17:00.000Z	BGenesis	lunitik	Already there.
2005-02-24T03:17:00.000Z	lunitik	BGenesis	then you should call microsoft  :/
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	snowblink	lunitik	so edit the wiki ;)
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	lunitik	snowblink	I have... pleanty of times  :/
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	BGenesis		Damn, all I wanted to do was transfer my music :D
2005-02-24T03:18:00.000Z	Golfer		good morning people
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	snowblink	lunitik	that's the answer to your question then
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	lunitik	BGenesis	Microsoft employs people to help you with that... I'm not at a Winblows box... going by memory there  :/
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	Psyk[o		Hi...
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	BGenesis		ok.
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	lunitik	snowblink	I just think whoever wrote ubuntuguide (you?) was silly
2005-02-24T03:19:00.000Z	Golfer	Psyk[o	hello
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	Psyk[o		I need a little help..
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	lunitik	Psyk[o	just tell us what is wrong... and we will try to assist you :)
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	Psyk[o		I'm trying from several days to install nvidia driver on my ubuntu :( today finally i've installed it, but when the X session start the system is sloooooow...
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	what kind of comp you have
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	Psyk[o		the mouse pointer dissapear... the window refreshing is slow... :(
2005-02-24T03:20:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	a pos Duron 950, 512 ram though
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	back on linux.
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	snowblink	lunitik	no I didn't write it. However, I think numerous sources for how to do things is valid. There is always more than one way to do things.
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	do you have ps2 mouse?
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	lunitik	vixus	cool.. still can't help you more with the windows side though...
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	yes
2005-02-24T03:21:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	did you use "cat /dev/psaux"
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	yes
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Psyk[o	all you have to do is install nvidia-glx then "nvidia-glx-config enable".
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	lunitik		'sudo cat /dev/psaux'
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	narkceh		and then it didnt say nothing
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	make sure you are using the sudo!!!
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	it says nothing... but spits out garble as you move the mouse
2005-02-24T03:22:00.000Z	narkceh		i have written sudo 100034x times, and mouse doesnt move
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	mouse won't move... text should appear on screen!!, not really text... charactors
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	Psyk[o	MobyTurbo	I've tried, but I've received this output: Error: your X configuration has been altered., This script cannot proceed automatically. If you believe that this, not correct, you can update the md5sum entry executing the following, command:, md5sum /etc/X11/xorg.conf | sudo tee /var/lib/xfree86/xorg.conf.md5sum, otherwise edit manually /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the Driver section, from nv to nvidia.
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	how to change mouse settings in gnome?
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	Psyk[o		then I edited /etc/x11/xorg.conf, i've changed nv to nvidia and i've commented Load "dri"
2005-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	without terminal
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	you don't want to do it in gnome... gnome doesn't deal with that...
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	you have to use cli!
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	vixus	lunitik	Yeah, the linux side is fine, I can get into the Windows Network -> Our domain. It's my stupid windows 98 box that sucks.
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	cli?
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Psyk[o	you also need to comment out GLCore if it's there, and uncomment glx.
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	Command Line Interface
2005-02-24T03:24:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	the terminal
2005-02-24T03:25:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	but it doenst work
2005-02-24T03:25:00.000Z	zombics		what's the best way to install wine on ubuntu 64-Bit?
2005-02-24T03:25:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	so there is nothing to do
2005-02-24T03:25:00.000Z	Xappe	narkceh	have you checked that your mouse is /dev/mice (think that's the ubuntu default) in your xserver configuration (XF86config-4 or xorg.conf)
2005-02-24T03:25:00.000Z	vixus	zombics	sudo apt-get install wine ?
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	narkceh	Xappe	"cat /dev/mice"?
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	narkceh	Xappe	"sudo cat /dev/mice"?
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	zombics	vixus	he cant find it :/
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	ralf_	Xappe	that would be /dev/input/mice, no?
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	Xappe	ralf_	true
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	vixus	zombics	Who can't find it?
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	zombics	vixus	apt-get :P
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	narkceh		"sudo cat /dev/input/mice"?
2005-02-24T03:26:00.000Z	lunitik	Xappe	he is using a ps/2 mouse... psmouse is loaded... would be /dev/input/mouse0 for ps/2 and /dev/input/mice for usb
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	ralf_	narkceh	yes
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	Psyk[o	MobyTurbo	there isn't GLCore, and i've uncommented glx..
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	zombics	vixus	from what i heard ther is no 64Bit pack for wine
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	Xappe	lunitik	no, my ps/2 mouse is /dev/input/mice
2005-02-24T03:27:00.000Z	vixus	zombics	Oh, you want it to be 64-bit. Won't the normal wine work? (I don't know much about this stuff.)
2005-02-24T03:28:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Psyk[o	you might want to look at the error logs of X then (in /var/log)
2005-02-24T03:28:00.000Z	Psyk[o	MobyTurbo	ok, thx, I'll back soon :)
2005-02-24T03:29:00.000Z	Xappe	narkceh	check your XF86Config-4  (or xorg.conf if you use Hoary)
2005-02-24T03:30:00.000Z	narkceh		i dont have nothing but /dev/input/event0 or event1 or mice, how to chect XD86config-4?
2005-02-24T03:30:00.000Z	lunitik	narkceh	cat /dev/input/mice, see if that does it, (spits garble out)
2005-02-24T03:30:00.000Z	narkceh		nothing, ill just trow the computer out of the window
2005-02-24T03:31:00.000Z	zombics	vixus	i am using ubuntu 64BIT. if i can use the 32 BIT pac and it will work so i dont care....
2005-02-24T03:31:00.000Z	lunitik	Xappe	if the device does "nothing"... then how will it help to configure X for the mouse?  :/
2005-02-24T03:31:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	have you checked your mouse cable? Maybe its a hardware problem.
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	narkceh		i did check it
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	see if it's plugged in well
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	narkceh		its plugged
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	narkceh	OK

2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	Xappe	lunitik	ah ok...
2005-02-24T03:32:00.000Z	lunitik	Drizzt321	udev

2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	Gul3		hi, i need a linux iso extractor. is there any?
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	Drizzt321	lunitik	MobyTurbo: thanks, I'll make sure to adjust my thinking, I'm used to standard dev.
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	lunitik	Gul3	you in Linux?
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	ill destroy my computer with hammer and axe
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	Gul3	lunitik	yes
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	narkceh	lunitik	and mouse too
2005-02-24T03:33:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Gul3	loopback device driver. modprobe loop; man losetup and go from there, pretty simple
2005-02-24T03:34:00.000Z	lunitik	Gul3	mount -o loop /path/to/iso /where/to/mount
2005-02-24T03:34:00.000Z	segfault		-t iso9660

2005-02-24T03:34:00.000Z	Drizzt321		very
2005-02-24T03:35:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Gul3	if you also need to make an iso, but not burn it directly to disc, look into mkisofs
2005-02-24T03:35:00.000Z	Psyk[	MobyTurbo	would you take a look to my xorg.log file?:(
2005-02-24T03:35:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Gul3	though most cd burning frontends will do that for you if you say to a file
2005-02-24T03:35:00.000Z	Psyk[		I can't understand anything :(

2005-02-24T03:37:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	indeed

2005-02-24T03:38:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	thats fine, I'm just letting you know for the future :)
2005-02-24T03:39:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	ok, have you tried looking in the grub man page?
2005-02-24T03:39:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	err...nm, that doesn't have much of that stuff
2005-02-24T03:39:00.000Z	mz2	Xappe	thx
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	Glen_		well do it on here then: i have ubuntu installed, i think my problem is something to do with not being able to boot from the second harddrive (hd1)
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	topyli	Drizzt321	well, the grub man page has almost nothing. see the info page instead
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Multiboot-with-GRUB.html
2005-02-24T03:40:00.000Z	Drizzt321	topyli	yea, I just noticed that
2005-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	Xappe	mz2	i change to jimmac yesterday because i got tired of waiting for an update of the industrial engine
2005-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	thats a mini-howto at tldp.org - the linux doc project
2005-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	Gul3	Drizzt321	thanks, worked now:)

2005-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	inser		hi
2005-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	mz2		fair enough
2005-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	Glen_		# on /dev/hdc1, title, 2005-02-24T03:43:00.000Z, savedefault, makeactive, chainloader
2005-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	inser		how are u?
2005-02-24T03:43:00.000Z	Glen_		that my entry in GRUB, i think i need to use the: grub> map (hd0) (hd1), grub> map (hd1) (hd0) but i dont know how
2005-02-24T03:44:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	also, please do not paste multiple lines into here, go to #flood or post it on pastebin.com
2005-02-24T03:44:00.000Z	Gul3		ok, so then a wine related question. when i try to start Setup.exe it gives me this: You must copy a 'stdole32.tlb' file to your Windows\System directory! You can get one from a Windows installation, or look for the DCOM95 package on the Microsoft Download Pages." how do i get around this?
2005-02-24T03:44:00.000Z	Glen_		oh sorry, just copied and pasted. i didnt know it was gonna do lodsa lines
2005-02-24T03:45:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	each line in the file will produce a line in here
2005-02-24T03:45:00.000Z	Glen_		ok sorry, ill remember hat in future, however do u understand what i mean?
2005-02-24T03:45:00.000Z	zombics		when i am trying to compile wine i get this error: "checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"
2005-02-24T03:46:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	so you have 2 physical hard disks that you are trying to dual boot?
2005-02-24T03:46:00.000Z	Glen_		yes, i think it is 'cos i have windows on my Secound harddrive, and grub cannot boot froma  secound harddrive, thats why i mentions the MAP command, i.e. grub> map (hd0) (hd1) | grub> map (hd1) (hd0)
2005-02-24T03:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	ok, so instead of (hd0,0), you would use (hd1,0) or if it is not slave, use hd2 or hd3 as appropriate
2005-02-24T03:48:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	heres the grub online manual with the naming conventions: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Naming-convention.html#Naming%20convention
2005-02-24T03:51:00.000Z	Glen_		<Drizzt321: is there a way i can just use LiLO instead, install LiLO to a Floopy or something and leave GRUN on my MBR just incease it down work?, because i have useds Mandrake before and LILO worked fine
2005-02-24T03:52:00.000Z	Xappe		hmm, the problem is that windows has to think it's on the first disk to boot correctly?
2005-02-24T03:52:00.000Z	Drizzt321		grub works fine as well, just a different way of doing things. I'm not expert on dual booting with grub though, unfortunately.
2005-02-24T03:52:00.000Z	Glen_		this GRUB doesnt work, cos it didnt work onn SuSE either, and now its not working on Ubuntu so it must be GRUB, ok cheers
2005-02-24T03:52:00.000Z	Drizzt321		heres the section on booting windows....   http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/DOS-Windows.html#DOS%2fWindows, not sure if it'll help more
2005-02-24T03:53:00.000Z	Glen_		ok drizzt321, can i ask, do u know where about i wud put the  "grub> map (hd0) (hd1) | grub> map (hd1) (hd0)" command in my menu/list file?, menu.list, menu.lst* even (the file GRUB use's)
2005-02-24T03:54:00.000Z	Drizzt321		yes
2005-02-24T03:55:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Glen_	here's the configuration section, you can use that as a base guide for adding in the section http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Configuration.html#Configuration
2005-02-24T03:57:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		anyone can take a look at my Xorg log? I'm fighting with xorg and nvidia drivers :(
2005-02-24T03:57:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	I can try, but I haven't run Xorg yet :\
2005-02-24T03:58:00.000Z	scoon	Psyk[o]	what is in the log.  what is the err ?
2005-02-24T03:58:00.000Z	scoon	Psyk[o]	i am running x.org w/ nvidia and all is well.
2005-02-24T03:59:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		it seems to is all ok in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and nvidia module loaded.. .but i cant start xorg :( the log is here: http://www.pastebin.com/241382, I have a Nvidia Fx5200 card
2005-02-24T04:00:00.000Z	Welly		hey guys
2005-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	ok, the problem is in your config file. you do not have a Screen section that contains a valid configuration
2005-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	I've had this happen to me before on X11, so you'll need to go in and edit your Xorg config file
2005-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	Drizzt321	but with the same config if i change "nvidia" to "nv" it works...
2005-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	go into your config file and look in the Screen section and see if something might need to be changed
2005-02-24T04:03:00.000Z	mat	Psyk[o]	are you sure the nvidia kernel module is loaded / is working ?, i.e., try reloading it
2005-02-24T04:04:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	mat	yes:  lsmod | grep nv, nvidia               3470364  0
2005-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	would you paste your config file on pastebin?
2005-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	Drizzt321	sure
2005-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	Drizzt321		thanks
2005-02-24T04:06:00.000Z	mat		also, if reloading the module works: sometimes, the nvidia module compiled for an old kernel (or an old kernel configuration), would load but not work. so you could just try rebuilding the module (probably useless if you are using the packages though)

2005-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	no, don't
2005-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	it'll be too large, we're just interested in the end, you can use the tail program for that
2005-02-24T04:13:00.000Z	vixus		Madman takes up 18.2 MB. I think its unnecessary for just editing id3 tags
2005-02-24T04:13:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		ok, I'm going to do that
2005-02-24T04:13:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	well, it does alot more than just tag editing
2005-02-24T04:13:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	you looked at the site?

2005-02-24T04:21:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	I thought I could batch them! :|
2005-02-24T04:21:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		it's strange... I've installed nvidia drivers with no problems under fedora-core and suse..
2005-02-24T04:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	yea, I've used them under debian fine, but not with Xorg, I haven't worked with that specifically yet

2005-02-24T04:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	ah...you can do that retag change thing in madman. not sure what else might have it, I haven't investigated that
2005-02-24T04:23:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_		Golfer sure
2005-02-24T04:23:00.000Z	topyli	vixus	easytag, or a fancy sed command
2005-02-24T04:24:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	I have no clue. it does seem as if the nvidia X drivers(not the kernel drivers) are failing
2005-02-24T04:24:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	you looked on the wiki.x.org to see if others are having this problem?
2005-02-24T04:24:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_		Golfer it says my partition table might be inconsistent but doesn't say me how to fix it up

2005-02-24T04:24:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	Drizzt321	no, I'll take a look... btw, thanks for all! :)

2005-02-24T04:26:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	ok :) glad to hear it
2005-02-24T04:26:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	um...I wish I had some bluetooth. if you send me it I'll figure it out for you ;)
2005-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	vixus		XD, But really. bluez-utils... installed it... then what?, (I've got it wrong right?)
2005-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	go to google and search
2005-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_	darksatanic	Ive backuped everything I need

2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	aaronc_uk		is 2.7 not higher that 2.1

2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_	darksatanic	should I format andrepartition everything?
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	Drizzt321	aaronc_uk	its 2.10, not 2.1 it wants
2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	darksatanic		Yes.

2005-02-24T04:30:00.000Z	aaronc_uk		ahh, not sure where to get that from
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	darksatanic		You can get rid of the partition table from a Linux command prompt with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda count=1 bs=512", (Assuming that the disk in question is /dev/hda)
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_	darksatanic	will it solve the problem than? I got no linuxI got just windows now
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	Drizzt321	aaronc_uk	no clue, you search the net for libbluetooth and find out where its home is? start there
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	darksatanic		If you wipe the partition table totally, it should do, yes., However, you *will* lose everything on the disk.
2005-02-24T04:31:00.000Z	_|Imanewbie|_	darksatanic	I will go fdisk old style :), I backuped university stuff just will have to keep soulseek open for somedays

2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	universal		ok, thx! i will see
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	membreya	mlambie	if you have a dvd burner change the ro to rw
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	mlambie	vixus	what dongle are you using? I tried with a belkin a few months back and it was horrible. never got it working.
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	SeanQ		i looked at ubuntuguide for universal, can't find it, can find how to mount it, but not fstab
2005-02-24T04:37:00.000Z	mlambie	membreya	true, but I don't ;)
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	darksatanic	membreya	I don't think using rw will make any difference.
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	hybrid_		hello
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	membreya	darksatanic	i had problems when i first installed...but i was using warty, hoary rocks

2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	Golfer		ro,rw makes no difference
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	darksatanic		Well, the reason is that the options there are only for mounting an existing filesystem.
2005-02-24T04:38:00.000Z	membreya		cept I cant install nvidia drivers!
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	mlambie		actually, my dvd burner is mounted with : /dev/hdb        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 ro,user,noauto  0       0
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	SeanQ		i don't think my wireless works with hoary
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	darksatanic		The writing is done through an entirely different mechanism.
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	membreya		aahh ... I stand corrected darksatanic
2005-02-24T04:39:00.000Z	Drizzt321		gah, burning a full DVD takes forever!

2005-02-24T04:40:00.000Z	hybrid_	SeanQ	is that a usb wireless adapter?
2005-02-24T04:41:00.000Z	SeanQ		yes, Netgear MA-111

2005-02-24T04:42:00.000Z	SeanQ		well, what kind of router?, i run straight netgear..netgear adapter -- netgear router, i'm a cheapskate
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	darksatanic	membreya	Take a look at your routing table., "route -n", You will need to hack that up to make the eth0 your default route.
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	sig_ubuntu		morning
2005-02-24T04:43:00.000Z	membreya		wlan0 is listed first

2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	universal		ok
2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	universal	Golfer	ok
2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	if you use unstable sources, some build-deps may be impossible. so you'll need to build them from unstable too. can turn into a vicious circle :)
2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	Golfer		it should show you what your problems are
2005-02-24T04:47:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	universal	you can turn on the option either in the nautilus preferences
2005-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	dejavu	casimir	can u guide me step by step of how to do so ?
2005-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	parazoid		Does anyone have experience with Unace
2005-02-24T04:48:00.000Z	zombics	topyli	o :< so ther is a guide that will tell me what to do :/

2005-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	universal	Golfer	ok, its all good, but when im trying to play dvd's it says cannot find input plugin for MRL (DVD)
2005-02-24T04:50:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	well, try apt-get build-dep libfoo (the one you need). If you can build and install it, you can then get the build-deps for the package you originally wanted, including your brand new libfoo
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		I'm sorry, but anyone thats have a nvidia card and Hoary can help me ?
2005-02-24T04:51:00.000Z	Golfer		universal have you installed everything ubuntuguide.org suggested

2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	dejavu	beep-media-player and muine :)
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	casimir		performance seems reasonable
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	casimir	I've trouble only with ubuntu... and I cant understand why :(
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	universal	Golfer	libdvdcss2, xine-gui, x32..thing.
2005-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	but that may lead to a viscious circle of gradual upgrade to an unstable distribution :)
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	casimir	can you paste in a private message your "Load module" section in xorg.conf?

2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	kapputu		hi, has anyone configured a acx111 card in Ubuntu?
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	zombics	topyli	this led to this: sudo apt-get build-dep libfoo libcapi20-dev
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	dejavu		how can i know whats the color depth or my desktop is ... i mean is my desktop on 16-bit or 8-bit or more .. and how can i change it ?
2005-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	kapputu		why does the module-assistant not know about acx100
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	Golfer		universal did you add gstreamer0.8-plugins
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	"foo" is just the standard unix example. in reality, you need libcapi20-dev at the moment
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	casimir	me to, i've got it working on gentoo, fedora and suse...
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	dejavu	that depends on your video card
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	membreya		nautilus applications:///Internet : "applications:///Internet" is not a valid location.  what the?! why am I getting this message?
2005-02-24T04:55:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	dejavu	I have 24 bit, from a card that's somewhat obsolete (TNT2 M64)
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	universal	Golfer	I think thats the problem!

2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	Golfer		universal then try that check again
2005-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	choisy		what does array-4 mean?
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	universal	Golfer	ok, but how to check that?
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	dejavu	MobyTurbo	but cant i change it ? i mean if my default depth is like 8-bit .. cant i change it to 165-bit ?

2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	hybrid_		the name
2005-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	dejavu	beep-media-player is based on gtk2
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	dejavu	that, again, depends upon what your video card supports. In order to change it you'll need to reconfigure X and restart it.
2005-02-24T04:58:00.000Z	vixus		Hey, I'm trying to compile Blue Remote., I need libbonobo-2.0, Any repositories that have it
2005-02-24T04:59:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	i'm afraid you're going to lose this one, the packages are too new or exist only in debian unstable or something
2005-02-24T04:59:00.000Z	dejavu	Psyk[o]	cool .. so it might be more efficient ! but i was wounderring if there is a sftware  like a mp3 juke box of something .. all in one type !

2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	usual	jdub	any idea why nautilus crashes X?
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	Omega11		windows is a defacto standard
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	zombics	topyli	no....
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	hybrid_		standars sux, **standards sukk
2005-02-24T05:01:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Omega11	POSIX is a standard, one that Linux adheres to. Windows isn't any sort of standard.
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	Omega11		what the hell posix do the first few letters mean peace of shit?, what the hell is posix
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	don't try to build it with apt then. go old style
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	zombics	topyli	when i am trying to compile wine this is what i get"checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables, "
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	posix isnt much of a standard
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Omega11	a standard recognized by the Federal government
2005-02-24T05:02:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	actually...I don't think so
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	ah, your build environment is broken. install the build-essential package
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	Omega11		well can you explain the standard
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	Linux partially complies with other standards too.
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	usual		is nautilus crashing X a known bug in hoary?
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	I thought it was one by ratified by on of the international standards organization. like IETF or ISO or IEEE
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	zombics	topyli	build-essential is already the newest version.
2005-02-24T05:03:00.000Z	casimir		what about SUS?
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	Drizzt321	casimir	I was just using those as examples
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	hybrid_		MobyTurbo; but not hardware sandards ;) but posix is very loose technically windows is posix...but is it unix? :P
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	yes, but the Federal Government prefers POSIX when they purchase software. It's why Windows NT contained a crippled POSIX DLL.
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	Omega11		hmm i am trying to crack my ubuntu does anyone have a serial number
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	they really do? kool
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	right, but the Federal government doesn't determine if it is a standard or not, it looks at what is out there and says we want this
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	Microsoft intentionally crippled their POSIX to be useless.
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	zombics	Omega11	lol? :P
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	Drizzt321		lol Omega11
2005-02-24T05:04:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	what does gcc --version say?
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	zombics	topyli	cc (GCC) 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-9ubuntu5)
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	they have regulations concerning what they accept during bidding.
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	; Microsoft cripples anything that gives the user more power then them
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	vixus		I need glib-2.0 -> libbonobo2-dev -> bremote
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	membreya		nautilus applications:///Internet : "applications:///Internet" is not a valid location.  what the?! why am I getting this message?
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	exactly.
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	vixus		What do I need to apt-get for glib-2.0 (dev)
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	look what they did to Java ("J++")
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	yes, I know. I work around the aquasitions(sp?) people. thank god I don't actually have to do that stuff
2005-02-24T05:05:00.000Z	hybrid_		and c#
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	topyli	zombics	hrmpf. strange
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	casimir		is there any way to get the deb packages from apt for nvidia to work with a different kernel version?
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	but you're mistaken in saying that Federal Government makes standards. generally speaking, they don't, they simply look at what standards organizations have ratified, and chooses from there
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	Linux has C# too. Mono. :-)
2005-02-24T05:06:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	I didn't mean to imply that they are the authority behind POSIX.
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	yea and it doesnt have all those wierd M$ warnings. but i havent go to play with mono much
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	Omega11		linux is the poor mans windows
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	I understand that, but I thought you were implying that Fed Gov't makes/determines standards
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	hybrid_		isnt it the open soure dotnet
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Omega11	no, Linux is the poor-man's Unix.
2005-02-24T05:07:00.000Z	hybrid_	Omega11	; Linux != windows
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	yes, Mono includes more than C#.
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	Omega11		yea but linux is better then unix
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	Linux is also the free mans unix
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	hybrid_	Omega11	; yea system V is obsolete
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	MobyTurbo		Linux has become better than any propritary version of Unix on the PC platform.
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	hybrid_		and if i am correct that is the newest version of unix
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	Bandit		"Linux; because a PC is a terrible thing to waste."
2005-02-24T05:08:00.000Z	hybrid_		lol
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	Bandit		a useless operating system, copied directly from the Mac OS, which prior to that, copied it from IBM. It's sole purpose is to make users even more confused and drawing more stupid users to the Internet. see also conspiracy, microsoft, microsmurf
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	mz2		hmm i can't seem to get X.org to work with my ATi card on hoary
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	no, the clean-room *BSDs are newer.
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	mz2		the screen's all scrambled and the cursor's this weird box
2005-02-24T05:09:00.000Z	Omega11		i use windows, because it just works
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Omega11	sure, games always come out for windows first
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	mz2		the fglrx module doesn't work with the kernel version i'm using, it seems
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	but they are UN*X not unix unless they got a liscence i could be wrong i dont pay much attention to BS, d
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Omega11	then go to #windows and leave us alone.
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	mz2		i've tried compiling it but it says: Makefile:50: *** mixed implicit and normal rules.  Stop., build failed with return value 2
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	Golfer	Omega11	thats why i am using Ubuntu :)
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mjr	better?
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	Omega11		tell me can you run essential software like microsoft office on your precious linux?
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	universal		Xine says maybe MRL syntax is wrong or file /stream source doesent exist when playing DVD's, why?
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Omega11	OO.org
2005-02-24T05:10:00.000Z	hybrid_		how do you do the *blah   ?
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	Linux isn't Unix either by that definitition. Net2 and 4.4BSD and Linux both have no AT&T code.
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Omega11	KOffice
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	Golfer	Omega11	yes I am

2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	mjr	Drizzt321	not really; people keep feeding it and that just makes it stink up the place even more
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	Golfer	Omega11	actually I am using all the the Office Suite through linux
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	; yup but didnt sco have at&t code
2005-02-24T05:11:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mjr	true. it is getting annoying
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	vixus	Drizzt321	I need glibc-2.0 for libbonobo.
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	Golfer	Omega11	for games I bought an Xbox
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	; oo just start with an asterick? ok thnx, lol
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	yes, because SCO sold propritary SysV Unix(tm)
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	and isnt that why the are after my beloved big blue
2005-02-24T05:12:00.000Z	vixus	Golfer	Xbox... for games?

2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Omega11		xbox is owned my microsoft
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Golfer		yep for games
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Omega11		i thought u didn't like microsoft
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	hybrid_	Omega11	yup but linux is on alot of xboxes
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Golfer		yep MS makes for awesome gameing
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	Drizzt321	vixus	not sure, I think 2.0 is probably in experimental...there might be a backport of it though, not really sure where you'd get a .deb of it though, sorry
2005-02-24T05:13:00.000Z	vixus	Golfer	a Gamecube, or a PS2 at a stretch has actual GAMES., :P, dern
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	Golfer	vixus	you should get out a bit more, http://www.microsoft.com/xbox/
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	hybrid_		did anyone every see Yoshi from the screen savers build his all in one gaming box?
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Golfer	actually, I thought it was Bungie that made for awsome gaming ;)
2005-02-24T05:14:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	SCO sucked even amongst propritary Unixes. All they are now is a lawsuit company, their products are inferior in every way to open source Unix-like operating systems.
2005-02-24T05:15:00.000Z	vixus	hybrid_	I read about it.

2005-02-24T05:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Rocha	now, if you want to manually download all of the individual packages needed in a seperate download program to limit the usage, you can do so
2005-02-24T05:22:00.000Z	mjr	neom	I'm kinda hopin' if he's 12 that he didn't get laid :)
2005-02-24T05:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Neil3	do you know many 12 year olds at all?

2005-02-24T05:24:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Rocha	because it doesn't really know that you want it to use a limited amount of bandwidth

2005-02-24T05:36:00.000Z	will		that was amusing
2005-02-24T05:36:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	kbrooks	you can't configure it directly via cups, it's disabled. Use "Computer / System Configuration / Printing"
2005-02-24T05:37:00.000Z	AngryClip		how does one see what services are starting at boot up, and know if they are safe to disable?, is there some super documentation on that stuff somewhere?
2005-02-24T05:38:00.000Z	vixus		How the heck do I bind my phone to an RFCOMM device?
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	AngryClip	the docs for particular services *may* be in /usr/share/doc or the manpages.
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	WillCooke		Can somone running Hoary with alsa sound try something for me?
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	mz2		phew, turned out the fglrx module was fine (that error msg i saw in the log was from an earlier bootup). but i did have to do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to get it to work after dist-upgrade
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	rfcomm --help :)
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	mz2		is that normal or did something go wrong with my dist-upgrade?
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	vixus		thanks sjoerd
2005-02-24T05:39:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	mz2	it's probably normal. I wouldn't worry about it.
2005-02-24T05:40:00.000Z	vixus	sjoerd	what is bdaddress?
2005-02-24T05:40:00.000Z	vixus	sjoerd	what is bdaddr?

2005-02-24T05:41:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	you cna use hcitool scan to find the bluetooth devices in the neighbourhood
2005-02-24T05:41:00.000Z	website	seacyd	maybe it is a new feature of that browser
2005-02-24T05:42:00.000Z	Golfer	AngryClip	also in /etc/rc3.d  all that start with k are shutdown when you shutdown and all with an S tart when you boot

2005-02-24T05:43:00.000Z	mz2		is there a way to make apt-get not complain about the gpg keys for the repositories fow which it's missing?

2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	you'll need to run it as root
2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	hybrid_brb		*laufs at Drizz321
2005-02-24T05:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321	hybrid_brb	dude, 512meg ddr400 for $40 after mail in rebates
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	hybrid_		512? wow
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	vixus		lol, sorry sjoerd. I thought my phone was denying
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	Drizzt321	hybrid_	yea, offer good throguh the end of today. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=586829&Tab=5
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	hybrid_		Drizz321 is it a certain brand or a depot with it on sale?
2005-02-24T05:48:00.000Z	Drizzt321	hybrid_	ultra brand
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	hybrid_		kool
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	Drizzt321	hybrid_	seems ok, pretty slow(cl3), but I wouldn't be using this for games or anything
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	deepsight		hallo ubuntunites, does anybody knows if i can put kernel 2.6.10 in warty via apt-get?
2005-02-24T05:49:00.000Z	hybrid_		Drizz321 : idk if i can use it with my ibook
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	Drizzt321	hybrid_	you won't, its not sodimm ddr, its standard sized ddr
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	vixus	sjoerd	bremote won't connect with my phone.
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	Golfer	deepsight	why not just upgrade warty to hoary
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	Drizzt321	hybrid_	laptops use 200pin sodimm ddr modules, not 184 pin dimm ddr modules
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	deepsight	Golfer	im afraid everything breaks apart, im a newb
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	hybrid_		Drizz321 : @#@#&$^$#(@.... oic
2005-02-24T05:50:00.000Z	vixus	deepsight	apt-get install kernel-2.6.10 ?, XD
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	vixus	sjoerd	Any ideas?
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	Golfer	deepsight	) its working very good for me
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	dunno how that works
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	deepsight		okey then, there i go
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	Golfer		:)
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	you can test the rfcomm connecint with something like minicom though....
2005-02-24T05:51:00.000Z	deepsight		the thing is that my usb hard drive is not working here with 2.6.8, and i read somewhere that they fixed something in .10
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	Drizzt321		hrm...so hoary is newer than warty? I though warty was the latest?
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	vixus	sjoerd	Minicom?!!
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	deepsight		hoary is testing i think
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	Drizzt321		ahh
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	Golfer	Drizzt321	warty is the latest stable, hoary is scheduled to be released in April
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	deepsight	more like unstable
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Golfer	ah, I see. if I'm used to debian/testing, would I probably prefer warty or hoary?
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	serial console program
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	vixus	sjoerd	rfcomm0: 0F:00:00:00:00:00 channel 1 closed
2005-02-24T05:52:00.000Z	deepsight		oh, thanks
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	sjoerd	vixus	that's a strange bt address
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	hoary is sort of a cross between testing, in that it eventually becomes stable, and unstable, in that things get broken a bit.
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	deepsight		i remember like 4 years ago i had debian unstable and weird things happened :D
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	vixus		yep
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	eKLim		hie... anyone knows how to configure USB DSL modem?
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	ok, so its probably closer to sid/unstable in the debian world?
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	vixus		I also tried hcitool cc FoxT610
2005-02-24T05:53:00.000Z	Golfer	Drizzt321	if your used to testing and dont mind it hoary is the way to go
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	vixus		Can't create connection: Connection timed out
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	hybrid_		is warty the first ubuntu version
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Golfer	well, I have never really found any real issue with debian/testing in terms of things breaking
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	Golfer		like i said no problems here
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	deepsight		glibc broke in old times and it was not nice, ancient times
2005-02-24T05:54:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Golfer	so you got hoary and in general use, no issues?
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	Bandit	deepsight	no troubles here either
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	hybrid_		is hoary based on sarge or sid
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	deepsight		nice, so there i go
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	hoary does have things breaking. If you're willing to put up with that it could be fun. Personally I'm running warty, but that's partially because I don't have broadband.
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	hybrid_	both are based on sid, except Hoary is more on the bleeding edge (stuff like xorg and gnome 2.9) than Sid.
2005-02-24T05:55:00.000Z	Bandit	deepsight	I am running a small server on it with no problems Server Uptime 4 days, 1:53:16
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	have you heard of things breaking all the time, or just now and then?
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	Bandit		but its what ever turns you on :)
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	hybrid_	MobyTurbo	; o ok so hoary is more in developement then sid
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	since I kind of want newer than debian/testing, but I don't think I'm ready for bleeding edge released yesterday kind of thing
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	deepsight	Bandit	ok ill adventure and see what happens, what i want to see is if it supports my usb external hd cradle
2005-02-24T05:56:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	things break constantly, but nothing so bad that you have to reinstall like sid used to do.
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	ahhh. would it make more sense to install warty, and see if I want to upgrade to hoary then?
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	of course, that doesn't mean that *can't* happen...
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	heh, indeed.
2005-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	sure. You can always dist-upgrade.
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	yea, I think thats what I'll do. Also because I already have the warty amd64 install disk burnt. lol
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	AMD64? You rock. ;-)
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	Golfer	Drizzt321	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/ why not check there  there maybe an answer to your usb
2005-02-24T05:58:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	yea, _JUST_ got it. primarily for games, so I have windows on it, but I want to try the whole linux only including games things. with transgaming
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Golfer	wrong person ;)
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	also a 6800 GT PCI-Express =D
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	Golfer		opps sorry
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	Neil3		hoary should be a nice release :)
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	hybrid_		unless u r on ppc
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	Linux supports roguelike games better than Windows. :-)
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	hybrid_		gnome only worx for me in fail safe :p
2005-02-24T05:59:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	don't I know it. I just keep coming back to nethack, I can't stay away!
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	Pointwood		have anyone experienced problems with adding new items to the menu? I right click, enter the relevant info and clicks ok and nothing happens :(
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	choisy		is gksu working for anyone in today's hoary?
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	mz2		does cedega work on hoary (or rather, X.org) well?
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	have you tried crawl (Lindsey's Dungeon Crawl)? That one is nice.
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	no, not yet
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mz2	cedega isn't X11/X.org specific, that I am aware of
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mz2	it just uses the libs that talk to the server. from what I understand of it
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	Drizzt321	I like the way Nethack has a kitchen sink. ;-)
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	Drizzt321	MobyTurbo	yup. literally, everything possible :)
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	mz2	Drizzt321	I know it shouldn't be, but I just know from reading earlier on that there have been problems with it on X.org
2005-02-24T06:01:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mz2	there have? hmmm
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	Drizzt321	mz2	you heard anything about an amd64 compile version of cedega?
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	mz2		wouldn't really know
2005-02-24T06:02:00.000Z	Drizzt321		damn
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	[sys] 		i'm having problems installing ubuntu on both my vmware and my laptop. is this the place to ask for some guidance?
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	housetier		it is
2005-02-24T06:04:00.000Z	[sys] 		niceness... :), i've downloaded the warty-install iso, and it fails the cd-integrity test, is it a known feature? should I download it again? in vmware I mount the iso directly, so I don't think the plastic is bad
2005-02-24T06:05:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	yes, you should download it again
2005-02-24T06:06:00.000Z	[sys] 		ah. oki. i'll try.
2005-02-24T06:06:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	if it fails the integrity test
2005-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	[sys] 		there is no image like the debian netinstall? a minimal thingie that downloads the packages...
2005-02-24T06:07:00.000Z	deepsight		creepy flashback going to unstable things...
2005-02-24T06:08:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	not sure, I don't think so
2005-02-24T06:08:00.000Z	[sys] 		k, thank you drizz. i'll try downloading it again.
2005-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	you're welcome. you might want to try downloading it via bittorrent
2005-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	[sys] 		bah... am downloading it now at 2mbit/s... enough for me :)
2005-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	it probably is more reliable since bittorent ensures that the file you get, is exactly the file you wanted, lol, ok
2005-02-24T06:09:00.000Z	looksaus		I'm looking for a Hoary package of vnc2swf, anyone?
2005-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		I'm going to install windows on my hd... after the installation how I can reverto the boot-manager to grub? (I dont have a floppy drive :()
2005-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	do you have an ubunto live cd, or knoppix?
2005-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		yes, I've knobbix but i can burn the ubuntu live
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	rubixXx		psyko you will have to reinstall your boot loader
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	well, if you have knoppix you can still boot it, and then reinstall grub
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	rubixXx		yep, if not you getta do it command line
2005-02-24T06:12:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		yes, but how?, I dont know how i can reinstall grub :(
2005-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	_4strO|Ult1m4t3		mIRC v6.14 Khaled Mardam-Bey
2005-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		ok so I have this odd problem. .., When I'm running Gnome... something is writing to my HDD every 4 seconds or so... on the dot...
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	spiral	hybrid_	hmmm... why a CTCP version ?
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		it's not writing much... about 20k or so.. .but annoying as hell.
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	hybrid_		spiral idk all i did was type slash ver to see what it would do
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 	Drizzt321	btw, when I've installed windows I'll return here with knoppix :) I whish you will help me ;)
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		How would I go about seeing what is being writen to my drive?
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	I'll be around
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	spiral	hybrid_	all right... I bet the answer won't help you much :-p
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	Drizzt321	Psyk[o]	far as I know right now anyways
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		Like top but for hdd writes/reads.
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		eheheh, thx dude
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		anyone?
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	Psyk[o] 		se you leater ;)
2005-02-24T06:16:00.000Z	hybrid_		spiral ; nope not at all, spiral what is ctcp, hey tritium
2005-02-24T06:17:00.000Z	tritium	hybrid_	hello
2005-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		ok ANYONE, please, do any of you know if there is a tool to see what process is accessing a device in real time... like top for HDD writes/reads???
2005-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	Golfer	hybrid_	ctcp = Client To Client Protocol.  More info about CTCP can be found @ http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/misc/ctcpspec.html  :)
2005-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	hybrid_		ok tnx
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	tritium	CubicllyCentric	lsof
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	TSWoodV	CubicllyCentric	look at fuser or psof
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	[sys] 		drizz: now it doesn't fail the integrity test. hooray!
2005-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	tritium	lsof, far to much output to go over...
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	TSWoodV	CubicllyCentric	lsof, my bad.'
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	TSWoodV	fuser and psof... I'll take  a look at these, thanks.
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	TSWoodV		Anyone else seeing lockups in firefox in hoary?>
2005-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	should be good now :)
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	yes and no.
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	i think it is either the flash or java plugin getting thrown some bad code and killing X
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	[sys] 		drizz: will the installer setup grub so it dual boots between my gentoo and ubuntu?
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	ssamf		the find as you type in firefox sometimes goes crazy
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	Drizzt321	[sys]	I believe it detects other install OSes
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	TSWoodV		I'm not running those plugins.  I straced firefox and found it was trying to access /dev/dsp.
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric		Can I make lsof only show processes that have accessed a file within the past few seconds?
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	TSWoodV		I'm thinking we're back to the nasty old esd problems again...
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	prolly thru the flash plugin, or because of.
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	vixus		Blue Remote rocks!
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	but it only happens to me if i have a bunch of tabs open
2005-02-24T06:22:00.000Z	vixus		Hey, can I create a launcher that carries out two commands?
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	eKLim		hie... anyone knows how to configure USB DSL modem?
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	binks		anyone no enemy-territory
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	TSWoodV	CubicllyCentric	I think lsof shows you a snapshot of what's open right now.  Create a script that runs lsof over and over and redirects the output to a file.
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	I've not loaded any plugins - no flash, no java.
2005-02-24T06:23:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	TSWoodV	ok... but then I'd have a large file and no way to use it...
2005-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	I've gotten it to fail once with just a single tab.
2005-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	TSWoodV	CubicllyCentric	what is it you need to do?
2005-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	sorry then, i don't know.  but I get your problem from time to time with many tabs and flash
2005-02-24T06:24:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	all tho, it used to be worse.
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	vixus		can i create launchers that carry out two (or more) commands?
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	it was real bad cuz my agp card and 1pci slot were sharing irq's
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	binks		how do i set permissions on a folder so anyone can read/write
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	I thought I'd mangled my profile, but that's not the case either.
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	TSWoodV	something is writing 20k or so to my drive every 4 seconds... like clockwork. I need to find out what it is, because it only happens in Gnome.
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	hybrid_	binks	try chmod
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	i fixed that and the crashing almost never happens now.
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	dutch		how do I change the path for the Download Manager ?
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	don't know if that would be something for you to check
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	vixus		Or should I do a shell script>
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	binks		but what code do i use
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	topyli	vixus	sure, but the second one won't run until the other has finishsed
2005-02-24T06:26:00.000Z	hybrid_		man chmod
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	Golfer	CubicllyCentric	have you checked to see what processes are running
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	topyli	vixus	so you can't use something like 'mozilla ; gnome-mines' i guess
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	vixus		ok
2005-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	Golfer	yes... but seeing what's running does not help me find out which one it is...
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	Golfer	it's to small of a write to make the process stand out in top.
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	binks		chso i would use man chmod usr/local/mydir
2005-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	Golfer	CubicllyCentric	well you may want to close some and see if anything you close stops it, that should answer your question
2005-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	this just started about 3 days ago.
2005-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	ah.  this has been going on for me during warty and hoary
2005-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	Golfer	I've done that before... in my Gnome2.6/slackware days... it's odd, I only note this on my home system and Gnome2.6+... every other system I've put something gnome based does not act like this.
2005-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	TSWoodV	CubicllyCentric	I've scanned the manpage for lsof.  There are some options in there for limiting the search to specific directories.  I'm guessing you know the filesystem that's getting written, right?
2005-02-24T06:31:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	it only seems to happen on the hoary laptop.  I've got a strange, small form factor desktop that doesn't do this.
2005-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	CubicllyCentric	TSWoodV	yah, I'm reading the man page right now too... I'm guessing it's my root filesystem, because I don't partition my drive past swap and /.
2005-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	x86 lappy ?
2005-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	P4
2005-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	x86.  dunno, sorry.  my story is different.
2005-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	rubixXx		where is the new gnome desktop dir
2005-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	anyway, if I kill the esd daemon, I don't have the problem any more.
2005-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	Merlin7000		hi there... why cant i get my ati and ubuntu to work... i have tried the guides out there but, when i boot up after the installtion it wont start the X, my xf86config is cleared and i can't make any other things than reinstalling the os, what am i during wrong ?
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	darkcmd		does ubuntu come with synaptic
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	yes.
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	maybe it is an irq issue w/ your sound card ?
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	look under the desktop menu -> administration
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	Merlin7000		someone plz help me i realy like ubuntu
2005-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	binks		merlin install fg driver throu symantic the edit x86config to reflect the driver
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	scoon	TSWoodV	maybe check your irq's, just to be certain
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	deepsight		:( the hoary upgrade stops here Automatically selecting en_US.UTF-8 locale in addition to en_US.
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	Merlin7000		have done that.. anyone with ati cards wont to help ?
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	binks		http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=5246, i did it this morning m8
2005-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	TSWoodV	scoon	all is good. ACPI is actually working as it should (hallelujah!).  It's just the age old problem of esd hogging /dev/dsp.  And that's even with alsa installed.  One of the days it just might get sorted out...
2005-02-24T06:36:00.000Z	darkcmd		where can I get some ubuntu screenshots?, also, does ubuntu use the standard debian repositories?
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	Agrajag		gnome looks pretty much the same no matter the distribution, and no
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	klaym		www.kotiposti.net/jisometsa/Kuvakaappaus.png <- there's my ubuntu desktop
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	Merlin7000	binks	thats the guide i have been using
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	binks		http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/screenshots/document_view
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	darkcmd		does it use ubuntu specific repositories>
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	ubuntu uses the debian repos.  Just be careful that you don't run apt-get dist-upgrade.  You'll be back to debian stock in no time...
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	drasko	darkcmd	no, it has it't own,
2005-02-24T06:37:00.000Z	darkcmd		so it uses it's own or the debian ones?
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	drasko	darkcmd	but you can add any repository you want...
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	Agrajag	TSWoodV	what, no it doesn't
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	drasko is correct in that there are specific ubuntu repos.  You can add the debian ones back in in just about amount you'd like.
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	Agrajag		you CAN, but you shouldn't, and they're not in sources.list unless you add them yourself
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	darkcmd		nah i would just like to use the ubuntu ones, if I do dist upgrade with the ubunto ones
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	drasko	darkcmd	just edit /etc/apt/sources-list
2005-02-24T06:38:00.000Z	darkcmd		am I safe
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	TSWoodV	Agrajag	I'm running universe against this hoary and am having no problems.  With the right sources.list, you'll be just fine.
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	drasko	darkcmd	I agree...
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	scoon		so, if someone added all debian repos and then did a dist-upgrade this would not be ubuntu anymore ?
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	davix		need help, I can hear music in the gnome music player, but not in the other audio applications... any ideas?
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	drasko	darkcmd	otherwise, you'll get Srage
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	scoon		could the ubuntu repos then be added back and dist-upgrade back to ubuntu
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	there's documentation IIRC in the faq at ubuntulinux.com about this.
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	TSWoodV	davix	warty or hoary?
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	drasko	scoon	right
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	davix		hoary, upgraded from warty
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	scoon	drasko	hmmm.  that's kinda cool
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	stuNNed_	topyli	ok! thanks! :D
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	scoon	drasko	anyone done that in here ?
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	darkcmd	TSWoodV	is warty the latest release, and is it based on sarge?
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	drasko	scoon	yes, I did it myself...
2005-02-24T06:40:00.000Z	TSWoodV	davix	same here.  It's all related to that dreaded esd and blocking against /dev/dsp.
2005-02-24T06:41:00.000Z	scoon	drasko	any problems ?
2005-02-24T06:41:00.000Z	davix	TSWoodV	erm, any ideas of how to fix it?
2005-02-24T06:41:00.000Z	topyli	stuNNed_	yeah i put something in. at least there's a link to the manual :)
2005-02-24T06:41:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	warty is first and current release.  hoary is scheduled for release later this year.  It's pretty good as it it.
2005-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	TSWoodV	darkcmd	as it IS
2005-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	drasko	scoon	nope... it even changes your desktop theme and your spalsh... Justa that several packages are held back and not upgraded
2005-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	darkcmd		I'm downloading Ubunto for my dad, right now
2005-02-24T06:42:00.000Z	davix		hoary is rather nice, will get better as it seems from this pov.
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	drasko	scoon	I still keep ubuntu repositories as well... So I've got some kind of mix on my machine... but it works great.
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	scoon	drasko	thanks.  i was always wondering about that.
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	darkcmd		what version of gnome is in the stable release atm
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	TSWoodV	davix	try Desktop -> Preferences -> Sound and uncheck the box that talks about sound server startup.  I've not checked to see what downside this has.
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	stuNNed_	topyli	good enought really the 'info' is all we need :D
2005-02-24T06:43:00.000Z	davix		ok TSWoodV brb
2005-02-24T06:44:00.000Z	TSWoodV	davix	then pkill -9 esd
2005-02-24T06:44:00.000Z	davix		done
2005-02-24T06:44:00.000Z	drasko	scoon	you're welcome..
2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	davix	TSWoodV	works like a charm :)
2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	topyli	darkcmd	2.8.1

2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	pythonist		Hi everyone...
2005-02-24T06:45:00.000Z	darkcmd		I'm gonna get ubuntu via the torrent I think
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	TSWoodV	davix	good.  Now let's figure out what that screwed up.  Does xmms/soundjuicer/rhythmbox/gnome system sound/etc. get affected?
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	pythonist		I've installed a minimal ubuntu on my DSL gw...
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	davix		let me check
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	pythonist		but I've got problems..., I can ping anything from any host inside my private lan
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	TSWoodV	davix	seems that gnome sounds (window openings, etc.) don't work.
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	davix		yeah, they dont work
2005-02-24T06:46:00.000Z	pythonist		but no internal host can connect trough http...
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	davix		erm is there an open bug report on this one?
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	pythonist		I can ssh to an external host
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321	pythonist	do you have NAT setup and working?
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	pythonist	Drizzt321	yep.
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	pythonist	Drizzt321	I can ssh to an external host,
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321	pythonist	oh. hrm
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	pythonist	Drizzt321	but as I type ls -l on a long directory
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	pythonist	Drizzt321	the connection just hang...
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	Freedomzen		ive got a quick question I have an amd64 proc running at 2.2 Ghz but cat /proc/cpuinfo shows that it's running at 1 Ghz
2005-02-24T06:47:00.000Z	cindux		=/
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	pythonist	Drizzt321	everything works find from the gw itself...
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	bc	davix	did you check everything related to audio in Synaptic, with the universal repositories included?, I had problems like yours, and just very unscientifically added packages till stuff worked
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	Drizzt321	pythonist	I'm not sure. I never had an issue like that with my own gateway
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	bc		probably a dumb way to do it
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	pythonist	Drizzt321	ok...
2005-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	cindux		er..
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	pythonist		Anyone got a problem like mine? I use Warty...
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	cindux		sorry = /, but i am having problems with shutting down
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	davix	bc	i wil
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	cindux		on my compaq it would say "Power Down." & I could turn it off manually
2005-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	davix		err, terminatorX just killde my mouse, errr
2005-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	cindux		now on my new pc it says "ACPI Power Down.", i dont think i shold be doing it manually, it lags my boot up
2005-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	Drizzt321		hrm? what the heck is grumpy and perky?
2005-02-24T06:50:00.000Z	TSWoodV	cindux	some machines' BIOS aren't really fully ACPI compliant.  This causes problems like you're having.
2005-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	cindux		so do i have to keep doing it manually ?, everytime i do, start ups hang more
2005-02-24T06:51:00.000Z	TSWoodV	cindux	see if there's a BIOS upgrade for your machinel.
2005-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	TSWoodV	cindux	you can also add "noacpi" to your grub configuration.
2005-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	TSWoodV	cindux	this will treat the machine like an APM box.
2005-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	cindux		hm
2005-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	darkcmd		how many packages are in ubuntus repository compared to debian?
2005-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	Allen		can some one help me in setting up ubuntu for a development box
2005-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	cindux		ask away?
2005-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	drasko	darkcmd	I guess you'll find everything that you lookin' for in Ubuntu :)
2005-02-24T06:55:00.000Z	Allen		i need stuff like cross compiler for arm etc..., i guess i have to build them from sources, thats what i have been doing, is there a way i can get them from synaptic
2005-02-24T06:56:00.000Z	TSWoodV	Allen	just add the debian repos to your sources.list
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Allen		thnks, i am new to this ...i havent used debian before..
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Drizzt321		wtf? whats the default root password?
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Allen		so i am finding it a little difficult to move around
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	drasko	Allen	do the refresh when you get in Synaptic, also...
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Jelte		hi there... I've tried to install winxp next to my ubuntu, however it seems to have failed in a bad way ;-(   cant boot anymore... so I thought I'd need to 'grub-install /dev/hda' to get things back to working, but (using knoppix and chroot /dev/hda1) if i do grub-install it says /dev/null permission denied ?  its crw-rw-rw- so why is it not allowed?
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	pythonist		Where's the kernel configuration used by Ubuntu?
2005-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Allen		sure, and there in one more prob that i came across
2005-02-24T06:58:00.000Z	drasko	Allen	but my advice is to go from the cosole, with apt-get build-dep <package>
2005-02-24T06:58:00.000Z	Drizzt321		nm, I sudo'd passwd and changed it
2005-02-24T06:58:00.000Z	cindux		er help me hardware moronic ass lol
2005-02-24T06:58:00.000Z	Allen		when running the kernel compilation specific to arm....i got the error of ncurses lib, i shall do it from konsole
2005-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	TSWoodV	pythonist	/boot/grubh/menu.lst
2005-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	TSWoodV	pythonist	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	drasko	Allen	happened to me for compiling the kernel.. you have to install ncurses...
2005-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	Allen		well i have it installed, i checked it
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	pythonist	TSWoodV	??? That's the grub configuration, I meant the kernel config (you know, .config in kernel sources)....
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	drasko	Allen	well, dunno.. ncurses are needed for make menuconfig - configuration in console
2005-02-24T07:00:00.000Z	Allen		i guess i will try it again, ya i knw, if i run a xconfig....then i get a diff kind of error
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	membreya		I'm getting the following when I'm trying to install the nvidia-glx
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	TSWoodV	pythonist	sorry.  Fedora sticks them in a config directory under /usr/src/whatever-build-this-is/config
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	membreya		dpkg-divert: `diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 to /usr/lib/nvidia/libGL.so.1.xlibmesa by nvidia-glx' clashes with `diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 to /usr/lib/fglrx/libGL.so.1.xlibmesa by xorg-driver-fglrx'
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	drasko	Allen	try make configure
2005-02-24T07:01:00.000Z	Allen		anyways i shall hve that tried
2005-02-24T07:02:00.000Z	membreya		anyone able to suggest anything?
2005-02-24T07:02:00.000Z	cindux		before I update my BIOS, this wont affect ubuntu in anyway will it ?
2005-02-24T07:03:00.000Z	Allen		but this is what i have felt......ubuntu is far far better than fedora.....and i have been using it for abt 2 days now, thanks drasko

2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	vi11e		I have a clean hoary install and I need that pack
2005-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	darkcmd	vi11e	you can also compile libdvdcss, and install
2005-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	drasko		ville, so apt - get wont help you a lot... unless you add some repository in /etc/apt/sources-list where you can find it...

2005-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	vi11e	timothy	you could try change ownership of that mounetd drive

2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	cindux		nope
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	hybrid0	cindux	why are yoy updating them?
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	drasko	timothy	why is a problem? Go to root comsole and issue comman mount ... what it syas?
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	cindux		I'm having issues with ACPI
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	Freedomzen		havent had much luck flashing the bios in nix
2005-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	cindux		and this update is supposed to fix that, & several others
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	Freedomzen	cindux	turn it off
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	cindux		but it sounds cool :(, "advanced"
2005-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	timothy	drasko	it lets me mount it, but once its mounted it won't let me view the contents of the folder to where it was mounted
2005-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	cindux		So, I just turn it of in my BIOS?
2005-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	Freedomzen	cindux	at the boot prompt, add "acpi=off" at the grub boot line
2005-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	hybrid0		*hybrid wonders why BIOS cd's aren't sold in stores
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	cindux		their isnt really a prompt though, goes t fast, to*
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	drasko		tmothy, try from the root console... change the permissions on the mounted folder with chmos..., *chmod
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	Freedomzen	cindux	sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	hybrid0	Freedomzen	what is nano?
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	vi11e	timothy	the directory has root permissions and thus you can't view it with gnome/x-windows... go to console and sudo chown its permissions to 777 and then you can view it with the browser
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	Freedomzen	hybrid0	a text editor
2005-02-24T07:18:00.000Z	hybrid0		oo ok
2005-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	cindux		= /, all i knew ubuntu had was less, er not ubuntu *
2005-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	liquidhex		I just installed array 4, and it was done installing and said to remove installation media so it could boot into my new install... And it just went right into windows xp!, the bootloader didnt install, what should I do
2005-02-24T07:20:00.000Z	vi11e		but I don't know if it will stay that way... try reboot your computer after that timothy and see if the permissions are still there...
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	drasko	timothy	how about adding to fstab line for example:   /dev/hda3          idedisk          ntfs               noauto,user,exec 0 0
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	vi11e	drasko	does that "user" mean the permission level?, what's noauto
2005-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	diego		hi all. i'm on hoary and i'm wanting to test out swsusp but when i run hibernate, swsusp2 is not in my kernel. what's up?

2005-02-24T07:22:00.000Z	Freedomzen	liquidhex	boot from the cd let it load all modules alt-ctrl-f2 to switch consoles, mkdir /mnt, mount /dev/yourrootfilesystem /mnt, chroot /mnt /bin/bash, grub-install hd0
2005-02-24T07:22:00.000Z	Freedomzen	Drizzt321	yes
2005-02-24T07:22:00.000Z	Freedomzen	vi11e	noauto means the filesystem is not automatingly mounted, sp^
2005-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	drasko		ville, not shure, though... root can be user too... and owner... I shoul look it up...

2005-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	Freedomzen	Drizzt321	no prob
2005-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	cindux		er, dumb question but when you say at the boot prompt, where? when i start up their isn't any pause anywhere

2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	drasko		ville, from man fstab:   Common for all types of  file, system  are  the options ``noauto'' (do not mount when "mount -a" is given, e.g., at boot time), ``user'' (allow a, user to mount), and ``owner'' (allow device owner to mount), and ``_netdev'' (device requires network to be avail-, able).  The ``owner'' and ``_netdev'' options are Linux-specific.  For more details, see mount(8).
2005-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	Freedomzen		but look for the kernel line

2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	vi11e		thanks hybrid0 , any suggestions tho?
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	Hwolf		ville: the basic stuff I do, nautilus handles fine
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	mebaran		My alsa suddenly stopped working
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	hybrid0		umm I heard cd parinioa is good
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	mebaran		even though all the modulst are loaded
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	hybrid0		how eva u spell it
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	vi11e		how do I stop my "blank cd" process with this integrated cd/dvd-burner thing.... I think it froze and is still 'blanking' the disc ?
2005-02-24T07:48:00.000Z	mebaran	hybrid0	I think that is the backend to nautilus
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	hybrid0	mebaran	i believe it is
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	vi11e		I want something that is not based on that nautilus since I am having major problem erasin rewritable with it :X
2005-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	hybrid0		oo ok
2005-02-24T07:50:00.000Z	mebaran		well you might have trouble, most cd burners out there are based on cdparanoia, I think, K3b is, I just did a reinstall of Array-4 on AMD64, suddenly, Evolution works, but alsa doesnt, anybody got any ideas
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	ssamf		isnt graveman the new cd burner that people like
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	vi11e		hmm
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	mebaran		never heard of it
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	ulas2		i have no sounndddddd, but i love hoaryyyyy
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	hybrid0	ssamf	is it based on natilus tho
2005-02-24T07:51:00.000Z	ulas2		what should i dooooo
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	hybrid0		haave you tried apt-get update
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones		gnomebaker looks like it is really going to be awesome
2005-02-24T07:52:00.000Z	vi11e		well I guess that nautilus erased the disc after all... I opened a system monitor and I saw cdrecord there as "uninterruptible' operation. then suddenly it disappeared there and console says "cdrecord: caught interrupted... but it seems the cd is blank... weird... probably by opening the system monitor I woke the process up... it was blanking it for like 15-20mins :P, but always when I start processes with cdrecord it says they have some problems with kernels newer than 2.5, so It are weirdz that you don have anny problam
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	ulas2	hybrid0	did you recommend update to me?
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	hybrid0		yes
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	ssamf		there were nasty audio cd writing bugs around kernel 2.6.8 i think
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	mebaran		anyone have any idea on my Alsa problem, Hoary, array 4
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	ulas2		i think i did
2005-02-24T07:54:00.000Z	hybrid0		and nothing?

2005-02-24T08:15:00.000Z	andrewski	jono	ok, signal looks fine.  what are your essid/wep settings? (in general, don't post your passwords)

2005-02-24T08:16:00.000Z	hikaru79		I'm trying to use FreeNX on ubuntu, but my client (Windows XP) is saying it can't authenticate the user. The forum says that to fix this, I have to give it an "SSH Host Key"... where can I find this SSH host key?
2005-02-24T08:16:00.000Z	mebaran		I used to just use alsa conf

2005-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	cindux		one stupid question, when I update my BIOS & say i reformatted etc, i wont have to do it again ?
2005-02-24T08:18:00.000Z	narkceh		i have deleted gnome and installed fxc4 and when i run startx it opens gnome, why?
2005-02-24T08:19:00.000Z	hikaru79		Can ANYONE please tell me what an SSH host key is? >_<
2005-02-24T08:19:00.000Z	YankDownUnder		If you've installed XFce, all you need to run to start it is: startxfce, SSH key is a security certificate. Just accept it.
2005-02-24T08:20:00.000Z	ssamf		man ssh should explain
2005-02-24T08:20:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	narkceh	Did you get that?
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	cindux		could someone help with ACPI?
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	Lucien		No.
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	cindux		:(, ah come on lol
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	Lucien		I use Windows again. Waiting for the hoary release.
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	cindux		im running ubuntu ><
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	Lucien		:P
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	hikaru79	YankDownUnder	I'm trying to run a FreeNX server from Ubuntu and from my test client (Windows XP), it keeps saying that authentication failed and the forum is saying I have to give it the "SSH host key"... any ideas? :(
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cindux	What's the issue?
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Lucien	i broke that habit long ago :)
2005-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	Dreamer3	Lucien	though it took numerous attemps
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	cindux		Well whenever I shutdown i simply get ACPI off right after POwer Down, but nothing happens
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	hikaru79		And yes I DID use --nomachine-key
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	hikaru79	THAT bit I wouldn't even beging to understand my friend
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	cindux		and when i turn it off manually my start up lags
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	hikaru79		I see =/
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	cindux		someone said i should add acpi=on somewhere?, in menu.lst, but i dont know where to add it, nor where menu.lst actually is
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cindux	You'd have to set acpi=on in the /etc/lilo.conf then re-run lilo
2005-02-24T08:22:00.000Z	Lucien		Haha, I think Windows Xp Professional is a great alternative for Ubuntu., But I will switch back.
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	cindux		= /, SO it can't be done from menu.lst ?
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	Lucien		I am sick and tired of patching every piece of software I download; and by that I mean 'patching' ;-).
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cindux	Edit the /etc/lilo.conf and for the default kernel settings, add the acpi=on in there, then run /sbin/lilo and reboot
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cindux	Better by hand
2005-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	clark		I'm trying to get php to work with mysql--i have everything installed and phpinfo() says --with-mysql, but php says "no such function" if I try mysql_connect(). anybody know what I'm missing?

2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	Gul3		someone?
2005-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cindux	If you open the /etc/lilo.conf in an editor (gedit or simiar) you will find a place underneath your kernel settings that says "append" => that is where you can add the acpi=on parameter => then after you've added that and saved the file, run "lilo" as root and then reboot
2005-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	xadas		msttcorefonts missing in ubuntu?

2005-02-24T08:28:00.000Z	andrewski	tritium	ok, but IYO is it worth a shot?
2005-02-24T08:28:00.000Z	tritium	andrewski	you can always try it, I guess.
2005-02-24T08:29:00.000Z	andrewski	tritium	a few utilities for work.
2005-02-24T08:29:00.000Z	tritium	andrewski	Or, you could install wine .deb from sourceforge and winetools
2005-02-24T08:29:00.000Z	andrewski	tritium	i have wine installed already; i don't need windows installed?
2005-02-24T08:30:00.000Z	graham		anybody here use a dial up connection, configured with pppconfig?
2005-02-24T08:30:00.000Z	hawkman		Can you have different desktop background in different desktops with Gnome in Ubuntu ?
2005-02-24T08:30:00.000Z	tritium	andrewski	it's possible that those utilities you mentioned will work under wine without needing to install windows
2005-02-24T08:30:00.000Z	njan	hawkman	afaik gnome doesn't do that (tm)
2005-02-24T08:30:00.000Z	andrewski	tritium	ah, nice.  man wine?

2005-02-24T08:31:00.000Z	hawkman		hmm I was sure I saw it in Gnome in FC or MDK last time I used linux on the laptop... I usually don't run KDE :) oh well.
2005-02-24T08:31:00.000Z	xadas	andrewski	do u know what repository contains msttcorefonts?
2005-02-24T08:31:00.000Z	tritium	andrewski	you might see this: http://www.winehq.com/site/howto
2005-02-24T08:31:00.000Z	andrewski	xadas	not for sure, but i think it's multiverse or universe.

2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	andrewski	Pinguvin	why don't you just install from the ubuntu repositories?
2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	ziggity		ok. so when the synaptic manager is done with updating - how do I find the applications
2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	tritium	andrewski	thanks for catching that :)
2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	Gul3		but do someone know how to reinstall grub?

2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	andrewski	Pinguvin	i'm pretty sure; i don't know why it wouldn't be in there.
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	clark	Gul3	take a look at http://www.desktop-linux.net/grub.htm

2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	Gul3	clark	thanks mate
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	vi11e	Pinguvin	you can, you should read ubuntuguide.org , there is a guide to install it with apt-get which is simpler than installing with synaptic
2005-02-24T08:34:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	search for mono in name and description? ;P
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	Pinguvin		ville, i alreadt tried whats on that site, but it didnt work
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	vi11e		I mean there is a guide with apt-get in console.. which is same as synaptic, what did it say
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	I found it .. Marked it for updating and applied it. It did the download and update.. BUT i don't know where it is??
2005-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	Pinguvin		ville, that was not apt-get though
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	me either; i don't know what it installs.
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	Pinguvin		ville and andrewski: nevermind it works now
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	ziggity		any one use the synaptic manager to load Mono
2005-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	use dpkg -c <name of mono package> to see what it installs.
2005-02-24T08:37:00.000Z	gma_		does anybody else use pppconfig?
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	: : Where do I use this
2005-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	in a terminal

2005-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	cblack	andrewski	probably some netops in #freenode.
2005-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	ubernoob		How is it with Warty and Horay? I know that warty is the stable version... But will Horay become stable after a while, and then use Grumpy for unstable? Or will Horay always be the unstable test-release? And stable stuff from Horay will then be moved over to Warty?
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	cblack	ubernoob	hoary will become stable.
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	jelte		hi there. I'm trying to install XP next to my already running ubuntu, but windows is being .... (fill in the blank) since it needs to be on the first partition. Can I move my empty partition to the 'front' for it?
2005-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	cblack	jelte	i don't believe so, no.
2005-02-24T08:42:00.000Z	gma		I used pppconfig to config my dial up. chat and pppd worked fine. Then one day I upgraded my packages and chat was no longer used; wvdial was mysteriously being launched in it's place. very weird, and a bit irritating as it wasn't configured and didn't work. anybody heard of that happening to anybody else?

2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	andrewski	ziggity	well, if the package is installed, you should be good to go if you can figure out which files it installs.
2005-02-24T08:44:00.000Z	pepsi		i have to disable DRI when using nvidia's drivers right?
2005-02-24T08:45:00.000Z	andrewski	gma	i dunno, i'm just leaving them open until the loser gets kicked.

2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	andrewski	benjanet	not that i know of, you can just download the theme and untar it to .themes (or .icons for icon themes)
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	duckdown		Hey all.. This is weird; I just installed array4 but forgot to pick EXPERT mode
2005-02-24T08:46:00.000Z	gma	benjanet	do you have a tar.gz of the theme? if so you can just drag and drop it into the themes dialog.

2005-02-24T08:48:00.000Z	duckdown		Is there a DEFAULT root pw that it is set to during install? ARRAY4 didn't ask for me to set one! I can only log-in as the user I created during installation

2005-02-24T08:51:00.000Z	andrewski	hikaru79	maybe no one knows their way around freenx? :)

2005-02-24T08:52:00.000Z	ljlane	duckdown	yes. "sudo -s" will open a root shell.
2005-02-24T08:52:00.000Z	flowerss		how do you enable sshd on ubuntu?
2005-02-24T08:52:00.000Z	hikaru79		Just ban them I guess =/
2005-02-24T08:52:00.000Z	duckdown	YankDownUnder	its disabled by default during install.. you can just do sudo with the administrative user you created no?
2005-02-24T08:52:00.000Z	hikaru79	flowerss	it's turned on automatically once you intall it
2005-02-24T08:53:00.000Z	raydogg		if ubuntu detected a wireless card, but fails when you try to "activate" it, what could the possible problems be ?
2005-02-24T08:53:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	duckdown	yah - just open a root termina as well - once Gnome has started...., *terminal*
2005-02-24T08:53:00.000Z	njan	raydogg	what sort of wireless card is it?:

2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	andrewski	if you're using Xchat, right click the user and choose IGNORE
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	gma	andrewski	I went Window->Ignore List, then added the bastard's user@ip-address to the list
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	ziggity	andrewski	Then what?
2005-02-24T08:54:00.000Z	gma	andrewski	It's just been proven to not work., arse

2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	njan	YankDownUnder	have done., I'd just rather they get kicked to prevent them doing it to other people :)
2005-02-24T08:55:00.000Z	raydogg	njan	dlink dwlg650

2005-02-24T08:57:00.000Z	raydogg	njan	did you get that model number? ( dwlg650 )
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	njan	raydogg	there are a few cards released with that model number, and it looks like most of them don't support linux
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	Lindo		im on mIRC i just right click em an presss ignore completely
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	raydogg		we've had it working in mandrake with madwifi drivers, will we need to do that here?
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	njan	raydogg	ah! You may be lucky then..
2005-02-24T08:58:00.000Z	njan	raydogg	the ubuntu installer should support atheros/madwifi chips..
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	gma	Lindo	good idea, didn't think of that. job is a good'un
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	njan	raydogg	so if you're having problems, I'm not sure what the issue'll be :(
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	raydogg		well, it detects it, acts like it is configuring it, but hangs on activation
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	njan	raydogg	is this during installation or post?
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	raydogg		after
2005-02-24T08:59:00.000Z	pepsi	YankDownUnder	there we go... 1600x1200 works right now :)
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	Lindo	gma	huh ? :p
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	mpq		could it hurt my laptop if I tried to clean the top of the lid with soap?
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	ren0		Hi. I am a bit stuck. My usb sticks don't allow me to use them in read-write mode
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	mike998	mpq	just be careful
2005-02-24T09:00:00.000Z	duckdown		yeah 1600x1200 worked right out of the fresh install... with nv driver too, not even 'nvidia', nvidia is the correct one right
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	Lindo		depends where you let the water run mpq :P, never did it to mine
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	mpq		I shouldn't even have to
2005-02-24T09:01:00.000Z	diego		hi all

2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	gma		anybody else seen gnome-smproxy blocking the login for several minutes?
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	mike998	mpq	I would reccomend using a wet-nap to clean your laptop
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	mpq		would that get rid of sharpie?
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	duckdown		hahaha
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	Lindo		...
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	duckdown		someone tagged you?
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	mike998		gotta love that ignore capability
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	duckdown	mike998	for sure
2005-02-24T09:02:00.000Z	diego		ok my filesystem's not happy (reiser)...it says "Filesystem seems to have fatal corruptions. Running with --rebuild-tree is required" on boot. what should i do?
2005-02-24T09:03:00.000Z	ren0		Sorry dropped out. I can't mount my usb-sticks in read-write mode.
2005-02-24T09:03:00.000Z	mike998	mpq	probably - sharpies aren't as permanent as they advertise
2005-02-24T09:03:00.000Z	mpq		I've noticed
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	duckdown		Someone found your laptop and went marker happy on it?, that sucks, lol
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	mpq		it was a 5 year old
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	duckdown		ouch
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	mike998		your kid, right?
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	mpq		HELL NO
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	mike998		lol - just be thankful it wasn't the screen

2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	duckdown		yeah.. what mike998 said
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	mpq		I've never having children, I hate them
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	ren0		Plus I have to type in sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt to make them appear at all.
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	Lindo		lol
2005-02-24T09:04:00.000Z	hybrid_		what happened?
2005-02-24T09:05:00.000Z	zenrox	ren0	do a sudo mkdir /mnt/sda, then sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda
2005-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	mike998	mpq	I got two myself... one from a previous marriage who I don't get to see
2005-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	mpq		ouch
2005-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	mike998		another one who's sick and whiney right now
2005-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	hybrid_		how old are they
2005-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	mpq		I hear about this kind of stuff, and I wonder why anyone would want that
2005-02-24T09:07:00.000Z	mike998		do what I do... Tell 'em if they go near my computer stuff when they haven't been told they can...
2005-02-24T09:07:00.000Z	maggi		hey how do I make a key sequence as a shortcut to change keyboard layouts?
2005-02-24T09:07:00.000Z	mike998		I tell 'em I will hold them upside down by their ankles and bang their head on the floor
2005-02-24T09:07:00.000Z	mpq		I wish that would work
2005-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	mike998		I have found that excessively violent and silly threats work miracles...
2005-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	sig		paste that last line I did a /clear
2005-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	mpq		my sister never listens to a word I say, it wouldn't work
2005-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	mike998	I just tell the kids "Would you like me to rip out your arms and beat you over the head with the bloody ends?" - works great
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	delltony		ok i have a question why do other users of linux knock ubuntu as being bad? i mean of course i'm new to linux and trying to learn but i don't see where it's bad at all it does pretty much what i want i want it to do. i just don't get why folks in say linuxhelp or whatever kinda shun down on ubuntu there must be a reason behind it
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	mike998		oh yeah...
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	hybrid_		no go to the store get them one of those $40 imac wannabes
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	YankDownUnder		Only Debian hardcore users beat up on Ubuntu
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	parazoid		I have an incredible annoying problem: I can?t play midi-files.
2005-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	andrewski	parazoid	sound muted?
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	mike998	delltony	there is a distro for everyone... just because it doesn't suit your needs... in this world it tends to be that you become something to shout bad things about
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	parazoid	andrewski	nope
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	hybrid_		ubuntu ~= debian and debian user == @$$3$
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	mike998		heh - there's even room for windows in this world
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	delltony		well i mean i just don't get it i'm sure like them i could spend hours on end trying to get the thing to work but in all i come to the same conclusion do i not
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	maggi		I have only one problem with ubuntu. (I use it) I had to apt-get almost all gcc libraries and all stuff
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	duckdown		What should ~/.xinitrc say? I just did an apt-get install fluxbox... should it just say exec fluxbox?
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	delltony		or am i missing something
2005-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	there is plenty room for windows but only on a house
2005-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	andrewski		goodbye everyone!
2005-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	mike998		lol - yeah... but in the computer world too... I have come to learn that there are people who want/need windows, hell, I use both - windows at work... Linux at home
2005-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	delltony		well i just don't see what the big problem is with it other than the upgrade is gonna be painful for me probably, cause i have tried it in stage 4 and it borked
2005-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	; nah lindows or w/e it is now is a good windows replace meant
2005-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	delltony		i just wanted to get away from m$
2005-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	yea i have to use windows at school
2005-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	mike998		hybrid_:If I could, I would probably use Ubuntu at work, but  because of some stuff I have to use, I am stuck with windows
2005-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	AlphaXero		i grabbed thingeramik theme engine for gtk2 from synaptic, how do I apply this?
2005-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	wine works miracles i tried to use a live cd at my school but our it guy has no idea what linux is and i got in trouble, :P
2005-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	mike998		I'm stuck with some ActiveX crap and the other weird stuff my company uses
2005-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	hybrid_		oo i c
2005-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	mike998		hell, we got farked by MS not so long ago (the company itself) so I have no love for Billy boy, actually, I have *ahem* borrowed a copy of cedega to try it out... it's great, but I don't play games enough to keep it on my HDD so I think I will fall back to wine
2005-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	my school is wierd they have an maac os x server teacher can work and all the client pc's are xp pro, lol
2005-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	mike998		strange... what is it you do at school?
2005-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	ren0	zenrox	. Thanks worked for the one usb stick. I put another in. It comes up as /media/sdc
2005-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	duckdown		fluxbox crashes like crazy
2005-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	i am still in jr high
2005-02-24T09:16:00.000Z	duckdown		blackbox owns though
2005-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	farruinn		I have an interesting situation: I'm installing ubuntu on a B&W G3 and the installer recognizes the harddrive as being master on IDE3 and calls it hdc but Open Firmware sees it as ide1/@0:0. Anyone with more knowledge than me know what's going on?
2005-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	mike998		ohh okay...
2005-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	farruinn		I get kernel panics when trying to reboot and finish the installation
2005-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	ren0		I can copy from sdc but not paste. Says it is read only
2005-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	zenrox	ren0	casue it detected a diferent stick so it mounted like its spost to
2005-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	yea how many 14 yr olds use linux
2005-02-24T09:18:00.000Z	mike998		true enough.  I am hoping my 7month old will be using linux as he grows up
2005-02-24T09:18:00.000Z	maggi		http://www.b2.is/?sida=tengill&id=92309
2005-02-24T09:18:00.000Z	ren0		When I first started using ubuntu it would just detect the sticks automatically..
2005-02-24T09:18:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	it is funnie they need a new it man and all but the schooling and certification i am qualified
2005-02-24T09:18:00.000Z	ren0		Without all this using commands. What has happened?
2005-02-24T09:18:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	yea it is good to start them off good. i started with windows 95 rofl
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	mike998		understood.  I am nearly all self taught myself.  It's been a hard journey, though.
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	ren0		I have not recompiled the kernel or anything drastic.
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	Hannes_	hybrid_	I used when I was 14
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	maggi	I don't know Icelandic :)
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	hybrid_	mike998	i hear you
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	Hannes_		:P
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	paulproteus		(At least, I'm guessing that's Icelandic.)
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	blah09		evening, i have a question, can i use the livecd to upgrade warty to hoary?
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	hybrid_	Hannes_	awesome
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	blah09	The Live CD is not useful for installing.
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	mike998		heh... It's true, but in this day and age, it's best if they know how to use windows as well as linux
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	blah09		oh, it doesnt have the debs?
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	paulproteus		So, blah09, I'm afraid not.
2005-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	Hannes_		first tried out in like -00
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	blah09		can i somehow download the debs from somewhere?
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	paulproteus	blah09	That's right.  Just the unpacked files, specially modified.
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	blah09		for someone with a 56k who wants to upgrade to hoary
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	paulproteus	blah09	You can change "warty" to "hoary" in your sources.list.
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	paulproteus	blah09	Oh. :)
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	blah09		=)
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	mike_douglas		I'm lucky when it comes to school, the IT admin doesn't know much about linux, but I'm given an entire lab to convert to Ubuntu and free range (as long as the lab works)
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	farruinn	blah09	you could get the hoary install cd and add that as an apt repository
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	hybrid_	Hannes_	i tried mandrake at 13 but didnt get to do much but then i got my on comp and put ubuntu on it
2005-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	paulproteus		You can ask someone nicely to send you a CD.

2005-02-24T09:22:00.000Z	farruinn		Shouldn't ide0 be seen as hda and hdb?

2005-02-24T09:23:00.000Z	mike_douglas		It's just much better software, especially on the server side
2005-02-24T09:23:00.000Z	hybrid_		i think school would be more effect with irc then email, irc on their server b/c i read the employees email all the time, :P

2005-02-24T09:28:00.000Z	Hannes_	linuxn00b	what does it say?
2005-02-24T09:28:00.000Z	malte`		how come i installed libqt3-dev-mt and i still can't compile QT apps?
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	paulproteus	malte`	What error do you get?, You might need --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3/ or =/usr/include/qt/
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	linuxn00b		well in sound juicer the mp3 button is grayed out and grip says encoder not found
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	jlj		I'm running hoary with latest updates, when I connect an usb drive I have to kill gnome-vfs-daemon to get the drive to show up on the desktop, is this a known problem?
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	mat	linuxn00b	tried installing gstreamer-lame ?
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	edi		hello
2005-02-24T09:29:00.000Z	linuxn00b		mat yup
2005-02-24T09:30:00.000Z	bob2	malte`	install build-essential and read /usr/share/doc/libqt3-mt-dev/README.Debian
2005-02-24T09:30:00.000Z	malte`		thanks bob2 i'll read it, (i installed build-essentials)
2005-02-24T09:30:00.000Z	mpq		anyone know if winamp will run with wine?
2005-02-24T09:30:00.000Z	bob2		I wouldn't bother, but probably
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	mpq		I wouldn't either but it's the only player that supports mp3pro encoding
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	mpq	Why ITH would you want to run WinAMP under linux?
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	omar		has anyone ever had a problem with modifying their $PATH ??  I am installing xfce and it says in cannot find a file even though the file is there?
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	bob2		then don't do mp3 encoding
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	linuxn00b		i'm not sure what to do now, because I need these in mp3 format. :/
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	mpq		I'm not the one who did it
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	bob2		there's enough proprietary junk in the world already
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	mpq		some idiot is broadcasting an internet radio station in mp3pro
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	bob2		gah
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	mpq		and it sounds horrible without the codec
2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	Hannes_	linuxn00b	rip to ogg
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	install lame.  use grip.
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	linuxn00b	Hannes_	I would love to but my cd player in the car doesnt play igg
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	bob2		getting soundjuicer to work would be horribly annoying
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	mebaran		ok
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	linuxn00b	bob2	I tried grip it doesnt notice I installed lame
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	mebaran		so I manually removed every trace of alsa on my system, which left me with oss, unfortunately, now system sounds work
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	it doesn't care if you installed it or not
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	mebaran		but ALSA will not work at all, I need to figure out how to make dpkg restore the device scripts
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	and if it doesn't work, then you didn't install lame properly
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	"device scripts"?
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	mebaran		yeah
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	sgtshatta		how does one change their path $PATH ??
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	mebaran		the ones
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	linuxn00b	bob2	well how to I install it right I used synaptic
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	mebaran		in like /etc/alsa
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	slackd00d		how do i su - to root in ubuntu? i was never promted to enter a root password during installation
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	install the "lame" package.
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	you deleted them?
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	slackd00d	please read the FAQ
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	Hannes_	slackd00d	sudo
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	mebaran		yeah, as my sound did not work at all
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	why?
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	mpq		which is better, ogg or m4a?
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	slackd00d	bob2	will do
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		I manually deleted every remnant of alsa
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	hybrid_		ogg
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	slackd00d	Hannes_	thanks
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		as stated by whereis
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	no, you don't ever delete files you don't understand, it will only break things
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	sgtshatta		slack00d: sudo su
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		well mny sound was completely broken before, now only xmms is broken, I read the scripts
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	bob2		yes, and deleting them did not help
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	zenrox		yep
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		well I get system sounds now bob2
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mpq		yeah, I'm not going to bother with winamp
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	bob2		well, ok, but hat's not because you deleted them
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	mebaran		I think it is because oss took over
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	sgtshatta	what are you trying to do?
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	mpq		this is listenable for talk radio
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	mebaran		because alsa cant load anymore
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	slackd00d	sgtshatta	thank you
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	sgtshatta		slack00d: no prob
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	linuxn00b		well if anyone is interested this is my cd player http://tinyurl.com/64pnj
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	mebaran	bob2	, what would you suggest then
2005-02-24T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	if you can't run "lame" from the command line, you don't have it installed
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mebaran		I reinstalled the alsa pakages multiple times
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mpq		why is it called lame?
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mebaran		and I never go sound
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	I have no idea what your original problem was, but randoly deleting files is never a good idea
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	linuxn00b	bob2	I can run it in the command line
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mebaran		heheh
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	how would reinstalling them help?
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mpq		that filename is lame
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mebaran		I dont know
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	bob2		right
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	mebaran		I looked through everything though, it was quite baffling, the mixer settings were fine, amixer said everything was good
2005-02-24T09:36:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	and you put the right path into grip?
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	mebaran		esd was loaded
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	bob2		ok...
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	mebaran		but still no sound, so I decided maybe I should purge my system of alsa
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	linuxn00b	bob2	it just says lame
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	mebaran		and do a fresh install
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	linuxn00b	try putting the full path in there
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	mebaran	bob2	how does Ubuntu make the scripts in the first place
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	topyli	mpq	"Lame Ain't an Mp3 Encoder"? :)
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	mpq		lol
2005-02-24T09:37:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	if you're using OSS, it doesn't matter if they exist or not
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	linuxn00b	bob2	ok well I put in the whole path now it works thanks :)
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	mebaran		well I prefer ALSA
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	bob2		but they come from various alsa-* packages, so you need to purge and reinstall them
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	mebaran		because have very poor quality
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	bob2		and not ever do silly things like that again
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	mebaran		sorry bob2, I thought if it was broken, it wouldnt matter if I break it more
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	e-Jah		re
2005-02-24T09:38:00.000Z	bob2		I really doubt it was broken, in that sense, anyway
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	mebaran		ok, I am just going to try a reinstall
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	bob2		of what?
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	mebaran		I fix the right way, of ubuntu, seems the easiest way
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	bob2		how would that help?, if it didn't work before, why would it work now?
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	[Spooky] 		man i forgotted the user password on my kids computer, am i f*cked ?
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	mebaran		try a later disc image, maybe they fixed
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	Gul3		hello, can someone paste me the linux part of theire /boot/grub/menu.lst file?, in a new dialog window please
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	hybrid_		Spooky no, login as root
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	bob2	[Spooky]	boot the rescue image from grub
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	hybrid_		then passwd username
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	mebaran		thanks anyway
2005-02-24T09:40:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	hybrid_	dont have root yet, and no mouse hehe
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	delltony		want sudo su give him root?
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	bob2		"won't", yes.
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	hybrid_	[Spooky]	how do you not have root? o_0
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	bob2		not if you can't login, tho.
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	delltony		won't want whatever
2005-02-24T09:41:00.000Z	hybrid_		not if you cant login
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	bob2		they are seperate words.
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	hybrid_	because i have installed the os and havent had it working since no mouse...
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	delltony		again who cares :)
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	hybrid_		o i c
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	hybrid_	should i do a re-install ?
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	hybrid_		well do you have lynx somehow?
2005-02-24T09:42:00.000Z	bob2		no
2005-02-24T09:43:00.000Z	bob2	[Spooky]	boot the rescue image from grub, then set a new password
2005-02-24T09:43:00.000Z	hybrid_		yea bob2 is prolly got the best idea
2005-02-24T09:43:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	bob2	ok and the command for that is ?
2005-02-24T09:44:00.000Z	bob2	[Spooky]	for what?
2005-02-24T09:44:00.000Z	[Spooky] 		set a new pass...
2005-02-24T09:44:00.000Z	delltony		option 2 from the grub menu is it not?
2005-02-24T09:44:00.000Z	bob2		"passwd user_name" once you've booted into root.
2005-02-24T09:44:00.000Z	[Spooky] 		just passwd login ?
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	bob2		once you've got in, yes.
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	bob2	ok but as i told i dont have root...
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	bob2		*sigh*, yes, that's why I said the frst thing twice.
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	delltony		spooky: restart and when grub comes up there are options, :), i believe its number 2 correct me if i'm wrong
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	[Spooky] 		aha sorry my lamenes hehe
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	bob2		it's marked "rescue" or "emergency" or such
2005-02-24T09:46:00.000Z	hybrid_		*hybrid wonders if using a livecd you could change the pass
2005-02-24T09:46:00.000Z	bob2		yes, of course, but that's more of a pain in the arse
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	hybrid_		o
2005-02-24T09:47:00.000Z	farruinn		has the SupportedHardware wiki page been taken down entirely?
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	mpq		I tried using those cleaning wipes to get the marker off the computer, it didn't do a thing
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	newbie4sure		excuse me .. this may be a bit off-topic
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	hybrid_	[Spooky]	well any way you can get root you can change the pass pretty much
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	newbie4sure		but is bsrf down? and y?
2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	farruinn		nm, I was looking for the HardwareSupport page

2005-02-24T09:48:00.000Z	bob2		"bsrf"?

2005-02-24T09:51:00.000Z	SeanQ		Question.

2005-02-24T09:51:00.000Z	hybrid_		well a good command is make love or more beer
2005-02-24T09:51:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	bob2	ok well thanks anyway...
2005-02-24T09:51:00.000Z	bob2	[Spooky]	if you hit escape at the right time, you will get a menu
2005-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	SeanQ		Somehow, my Rhythmbox stops loading songs..[I have a library of about 1000 over 2 folders]  but still says Loading Songs..?, How can I get these songs to load?, I tried to --debug it but to no avail
2005-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	bob2		rhythmbox has lots of problems like that, unfortunately
2005-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	topyli	hybrid_	there's this debian package... manpages-funny or something. there's also one for the asr-manpages (alt.sysadmin.recovery)
2005-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	cowbud	SeanQ	sometimes just letting it sit there for a long time it will eventually stop..
2005-02-24T09:52:00.000Z	hybrid_		topli lol
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	[Spooky] 	bob2	did that from the start... with no succsess... il just re-install it...
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	bob2		er, that's a bit extreme
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	SeanQ	cowbud	I don't want it to stop, though..I want it to keep loading songs
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	bob2		s/bit/lot/
2005-02-24T09:53:00.000Z	SeanQ		well xmms isn't doing much better either
2005-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	hybrid_		does anyone know of another command line browser besides lynx
2005-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	randabis		links, elinks
2005-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	SeanQ		links, elinks, were just said, lol, w3m, and xemacs + w3m together
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	randabis		heh
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	hybrid_		can i apt-get any of them
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	randabis		yes
2005-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	hybrid_		ok
2005-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	Jah_Raztah		Hi, I'm new to the linux scene I was think about trying ubunutu, and I was on the website... now I selected to download and i was taking to a site with a alot of download options, I'm currently running AMD thunderbrid 1.4 ghz and a ECS k7s5a mother board, so which iso would you guys recommend I download
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	SeanQ	Jah_Raztah	all depends on the processor chipset, is that AMD an AMD-64?
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	darren_		i tried unmask=002   but i get mount error, unrecognised mount option unmask=002  on startup
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	bob2		no it doesn't
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	Jah_Raztah		as i said AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.4 Ghz
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	bob2	Jah_Raztah	i386 is the only one which will work
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	darren_	I said umask, not unmask
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	SeanQ		Right, that would be an i386..I think
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	Jah_Raztah		ok thank you bob2
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	SeanQ		as bob said, yeah, it is an x86/i387
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	Jah_Raztah		and also thank you SeanQ
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	SeanQ		i386, No problem, welcome to Linux. :)
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	darren_		ooops..sorry bob2...misread, ill try again...thanks
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	Jah_Raztah		this be the one i download warty-release-install-i386.iso?
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	SeanQ		Yes. :_
2005-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	Jah_Raztah		alright thanks
2005-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	SeanQ		Great..now my Rhythmbox won't even open
2005-02-24T10:04:00.000Z	cyklus		something is very wrong. when i type top total swap is 0k... i have the following line in fstab: /dev/hda4 none swap sw 0 0 ..however when i type df -h this shows up: none 5.0M  2.8M  2.3M  56% /dev  ...anyone know whats going on? ...i should have 512mb swap
2005-02-24T10:04:00.000Z	darren_	bob2	thanks heaps, windows partition is now working as i want it to under linux :)
2005-02-24T10:05:00.000Z	zenrox		lol, another sucess storie
2005-02-24T10:05:00.000Z	darren_		lol yeah
2005-02-24T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	cyklus	that line from df has nothing to do with your swap partition
2005-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	cyklus	bob2	ok, but still doesnt explain why i have no swap space
2005-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	darren_		anyway, im off...cya all later, thanks again
2005-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	bob2	cyklus	well, true, but it's still unrelated
2005-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	zenrox	cyklus	at 512 mbs of ram you dont really need a swap
2005-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	bob2		"swapon -s" is the only thing that gives information about swap, er, yeah you do, I have 512MB of ram and 447MB of swap in use
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	zenrox		but not as much, i have 256mbs of swap
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	farruinn		os x uses swapfiles, does windows use swap space at all?
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	zenrox		and i only use 3 megs of that swap
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	bob2	farruinn	yes
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	zenrox		very badly too
2005-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	bob2		swapfiles like linux and mac os x, more or les
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	mebaran		I am having ALSA trouble
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	cyklus	bob2	it returns nothing when i type swapon -s
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	bob2		then you have no swap
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	mebaran	bob2	I am now back to square one, I have done a clean reinstall
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	bob2		wow, I'm really surprised reinstalling didn't magically fix it!, ;)
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	cyklus	bob2	any idea why?
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	mebaran		now how would I go about trouble shooting this properly
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	Pinguvin		how do i edit the kernel boot-up arguments from gnome?
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	mebaran		no, I knew it wouldnt
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	bob2	cyklus	sudo swapon -a
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	mebaran		I just wanted to get back to this
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	bob2	Pinguvin	with a text editor, anyway, adios
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	qpid		does it give a x scp/ssh/sftp client in the packets?
2005-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	Pinguvin	bob2	yes but where is it
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	mebaran		a point from which everything is setup
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	cyklus	bob2	swapon: /dev/hda4: Invalid argument
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	bob2	Pinguvin	/boot/grub/menu.lst or so
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	Pinguvin	bob2	thanks
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	mebaran		so does anyone have any idea as ti how to fix it
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	bob2	qpid	no, that would be pointless, but nautilus can do sftp.
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	you're being so vague that no one can help you
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	mebaran		ah, Well I dont know where to begin
2005-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	mpq		is there a word for an op that's above other ops and can therefore do whatever he wants?
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	mebaran	write an email to the list explaning what you think isn't working, and why
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	mebaran		I have all the modules loaded
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	mpq	no
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	mebaran		and mixer
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	mpq	there are ircops, but that's different
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	mebaran		seems to be setup right
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	mpq		there should be a word
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	cyklus	then perhaps that partition doesn't exist
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	mpq	why?
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	qpid	bob2	hmm ok
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	qpid	bob2	thx
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2		or do you mean "channel founder"?
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	mpq		there's this guy in another channel that spontaneously spammed
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	cyklus	bob2	i just checked and its there... and set as linux swap / solaris
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	bob2		ok!
2005-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	mpq		and he runs the website that the channel's for, so nobody can touch him
2005-02-24T10:11:00.000Z	qpid		somone knows a well x scp client? ;)
2005-02-24T10:11:00.000Z	bob2		so move to a channel without idiot ops, irc politics is about as pointless as anything in the universe
2005-02-24T10:11:00.000Z	mpq		lol, nobody really cares
2005-02-24T10:11:00.000Z	mebaran		so bob2, what list would I go to then, to report my misfortune
2005-02-24T10:11:00.000Z	mpq		he said "I WILL DRIVE FOR YOU" nine times in a row
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	cyklus	bob2	i checked /dev and its there ad well
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	mpq		well, I just made a troublesome discovery, the touchpad off button doesn't do anything in linux
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		I think I've got the nvidia driver loaded but glx isn't working right, I installed it using the ubuntu packages
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	mpq		the light goes on and off when I press the button but the touchpad stays on
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	bob2		try again, and follow the instructions exactly
2005-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	ziggity		Is there anyone who's successfully installed monodevelope IDE
2005-02-24T10:13:00.000Z	mebaran		I believe it is a mixer problem, but I really wouldnt know
2005-02-24T10:14:00.000Z	mebaran	bob2	but magically, since the reinstall Evolution works, what a world this is
2005-02-24T10:14:00.000Z	redissexy		where do windows network directroies get mounted?
2005-02-24T10:14:00.000Z	blah09		whereever you specify in /etc/fstab
2005-02-24T10:15:00.000Z	duckdown		How can I get the VGA font for my x terminals?
2005-02-24T10:15:00.000Z	SeanQ		this is making me mad.
2005-02-24T10:15:00.000Z	arbeck		can someone help me with importing mail?  I have a mail folder that I copied from my old thunderbird install on my old PC... i'd like to import the inbox into my current mail, how do I do that?
2005-02-24T10:15:00.000Z	sasib2		Hello room. :)

2005-02-24T10:16:00.000Z	ziggity		Is there anyone who's successfully installed monodevelope IDE
2005-02-24T10:16:00.000Z	blah09		no idea ive never done it that way before ;)
2005-02-24T10:16:00.000Z	sasib2		anyone good at trobleshooting the xwindows installation?
2005-02-24T10:16:00.000Z	redissexy		tks :)
2005-02-24T10:17:00.000Z	Gul3		is it possible to grant write access to my ntsf partition using ubuntu live cd?
2005-02-24T10:17:00.000Z	sasib2		ive been all throught he forums with out luck :(
2005-02-24T10:18:00.000Z	Gul3	sasib2	talking to me?
2005-02-24T10:18:00.000Z	sasib2		anyone who is interested in helping
2005-02-24T10:18:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	I didn't think Linux had safe NTFS write access at all.  ??
2005-02-24T10:18:00.000Z	njan	Gul3	you probably can, but I wouldn't recommend it
2005-02-24T10:19:00.000Z	njan	Gul3	NTFS write in linux (even in 2.6) breaks stuff
2005-02-24T10:19:00.000Z	njan	Gul3	unless you're editing a file and not changing the length.
2005-02-24T10:19:00.000Z	Gul3	njan	i want to transfer some files from my broken linux partition to the ntsf partition using ubuntu live cd. possible?
2005-02-24T10:19:00.000Z	njan	Gul3	I wouldn't recommend it.
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	eyequeue		i thought there was some third-party app that allowed safe ntfs writes, by using an existing copy of ms libraries or something
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	njan	Gul3	I'd stick them on a networked machine, USB key, CD, or FAT32 partition.
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	vi11e		transfer your Ntfs drive to fat drive
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	Gul3		i've got neither
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	sasib2		anyone good at trobleshooting the xwindows installation?
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	vi11e		with partitino magic in windows
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	Gul3		ville: how?, ok
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	eyequeue		a non-free app, iirc
2005-02-24T10:20:00.000Z	vi11e		if you really have so important stuff, that you really must get them
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	blah09		can qtparted do that?
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	Gul3		wouldn't that break my windows system?
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster		anyone using the nvidia binary drivers downloaded from the synaptic package manager
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	wliu		can anyone explain why my sound card doesn't work?  I hear the startup sound play.  but after I log in, none of my sounds work.
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	sri		hey is anybody going to support ntfsresize in the ubuntu install?
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	what problem ar eyou having ?
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	vi11e		first you should check google about transforming ntfs to fat32 etc... if your ntfs is empty or useless stuff in there... then  you can do it at least
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	apokryphos	tha_gamemaster	I am
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	sri		so that you can resize existing XP filesystems?
2005-02-24T10:21:00.000Z	apokryphos		Seem to be working fine
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	apokryphos, glx isn't loading.
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	Gul3		hmm.. i think i'll try this another way. is it possible to split up a file into parts in linux?
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	vi11e	Gul3	well if you have your windows on that ntfs .... I don't know if it is safe.. read somewhere or maybe someone here knows
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	I don't know if I'm "good", but I'll be happy to hear about your problems.  :)
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	did you add glx to your xf86config-4 file ?
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	sasib2		thx, moquist
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	are you familiar with the 'dd' command?
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	no
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	are you comfortable on the command line?
2005-02-24T10:22:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	add glx where?
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	yes
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	a bit..
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	man dd, and pay close attention to the 'seek' and 'skip' options
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	/etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	i cant get xwindows to start after installing ubuntu
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	that's one way to split up a file
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	eyequeue		that ntfs write app, "captive", for nyone interested :  http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/

2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	i don't understand man pages. lol
2005-02-24T10:23:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	there is a load glx reference under the modules, is there another place it has to be?

2005-02-24T10:24:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	i want to take it anoter way around then. how can i mount a iso file in linux using this live cd?
2005-02-24T10:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	it has nvidia set for the video driver ?
2005-02-24T10:24:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	basically, you tell dd where to get data ("if"), where to put it ("of"), how big each data chunk should be ("bs", I use "bs=1M"), and how many data chunks to move ("count").
2005-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	yes, nvidia is the driver not nv, and I don't see the nvidia splash screen, also nvidia-settings doesn't work correctly.
2005-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	then you can tell dd how much of the input to skip ("skip") and how far to seek into the output before writing ("seek").
2005-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	oh, that's way easy.
2005-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	mount -oloop -tiso9660 /path/path/path/myiso.iso /mnt/tmp/
2005-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	try modprobe nvidia
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	hmm...
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	sasib2		how can i check what ubuntu picked up for video with out a GUI?
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	then /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	it sounds like you're looking for two things from the guide url in the /topic  one, root password, two, allowing x logins for root
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	ok brb
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	are you familiar with your /etc/X11/XF86Config file (Warty) or /etc/X11/xorg.conf file (Hoary)?
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	projectmayhem		hey everyone, windows user hoping to swtich over here and have a few questions about installing on a new hard drive... if I want to copy all of my windows files over to a new master drive, do i first have to set the new drive as a slave to copy all of hte files from my master drive over?
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	neither are considered wise, but both are documented there
2005-02-24T10:26:00.000Z	linuxn00b		hi, on the top tool bar I cannont clear the stuff thats in "recent documents" i'm using warty :)
2005-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	nope sorry, new to linux
2005-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	Don't worry, I'll be alright ;). I can't seem to find the documentation for allowing GUI for root, though., I'm almost certain I saw it...
2005-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	thanks! then i can just burn out cd's from the iso! (it is a dvd iso but i just have a cd-writer)
2005-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	sasib2	cat /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 | grep Driver   will list the drivers for your devices
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	im on a dell inspiron 1100 laptop
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	I'd try 'sudo nano /etc/X11/XF86Config' to see your config file.  that's where I would start looking to answer the question you asked.
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	also, have you looked at your X server log output?
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	ziggity		Is there anyone who's successfully installed monodevelope IDE
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	no i havent,
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	just a sec
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	apokryphos		k
2005-02-24T10:28:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	and google is your friend, of course.  "ubuntu dell inspiron 1100 laptop"  :)
2005-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	ty, 1 min gonna try the commands above, :)
2005-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	cblack	ziggity	it installs fine in hoary
2005-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	ziggity	cblack	How do I update warty to hoary
2005-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	duckdown		How can I install the VGA font for my x terminals?
2005-02-24T10:29:00.000Z	projectmayhem		can someone here help me with a question about switching over from windows?
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	oh - here it is.  do "sudo nano /var/log/XFree86.0.log" also.
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	ubernoob	projectmayhem	whats your question?
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	cblack	ziggity	modify your sources.list. there are a multitude of docs on it at the website.
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	and you can switch between several different "virtual terminals" while you work on this - just use Alt+F{1,2,3,4,5,6}.
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	that way you can multitask.
2005-02-24T10:30:00.000Z	projectmayhem		I am going to move all my old windows data to a new Hard drive and set that as my master drive, but I want to install linux on the old drive after I move all the files over
2005-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	I've gotta go for about 10 minutes (feel free to type it and I'll check when I'm back). Thanks in advance for your help, either way. =)
2005-02-24T10:31:00.000Z	projectmayhem		but I need to know if I have to set up the new hard drive as the slave drive until I copy my old files over to the new hard drive, then set it up as the master, or can i just set up the new drive as master and copy my old files from the old "slave" drive?
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	i read it too, right under the "how to set your root password" iirc, but i can't find it now
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	SeanQ		I LOVE IT I LOVE IT
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	ubernoob	projectmayhem	you are booting into windows?
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	SeanQ		my internet "breaks" twice, first time is because i wrote the wrong word: prism2_usb instead of wlan0
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	ubernoob	projectmayhem	when you are copying, or in linux?
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	SeanQ		second time is because i plugged my adapter in the wrong way
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	projectmayhem		in Windows
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	SeanQ		lol both of those times my fault. LOL.
2005-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	there is nothing (blank screen except menu) in sudo nano /etc/X11/XF86Config
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	ubernoob	projectmayhem	then i think it is easier to set the new harddrive as slave when you are copying
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	sasib2	moquist	and i cant get out of it..... :(
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	thanks so much!  Everything seems to be ok, my glxgears fps is a little low, but at least it works. ^_^
2005-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	projectmayhem	ubernoob	ok, thanks. do you know how long it takes to copy a hard drive (approx. 90 gb of data) to a new one?
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	qpid		can i use xawtv without any problems under ubunut?
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	tha_gamemaster	ok great you should add nvidia to /etc/modules so that it will load automatically when you reboot
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	aarplane		hwllo, *hello
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	projectmayhem		hwllo to you to aarplane
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	moquist	sasib2	uh, CTRL+x gets you out of nano
2005-02-24T10:35:00.000Z	ubernoob	projectmayhem	it depends on the speed of the harddrive, and if they are on the same physical cable and all that stuff, but i guess it will take at least an hour
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	aarplane		getting ubuntu now :)
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	LinuxJones	yea that's what took me so long to get back, I was making sure everything loaded at boot, so after a few reboots, all is well. ^_^
2005-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	projectmayhem	ubernoob	thanks, cuz i was hoping to do this tonight (starting in a bout an hour) and i didn't want to be up past 11...
2005-02-24T10:37:00.000Z	duckdown		90 gigs will be a while, if its normal 7200rpm
2005-02-24T10:37:00.000Z	ubernoob	projectmayhem	then you can just leave the comuter working tonight, now i have to reboot to my ubuntu... good luck with the copying
2005-02-24T10:39:00.000Z	projectmayhem	duckdown	how long?
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	usual	ljlane	sup man
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	projectmayhem	duckdown	it's 7200 rpm western digital
2005-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	So I thought, too. Thanks anyhow., Does anyone else know where the article is that allows you to enable GUI for root?
2005-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	i think the keyword you want is "gdm" rather than "gui" (but then, i've just failed in my search, so maybe not)
2005-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	atmos		anyone know what package provides rake ?
2005-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	benjanet		is there a virtual package to get gcc, autoconf, automake, etc ?
2005-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	are you in x now?  as primary user?
2005-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	i can walk you through it
2005-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	projectmayhem		also anyone know a good virtual pc program to run windows in linux?
2005-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	That would be really great :), I'm as Primary user, yes.
2005-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	magnon	benjanet	build-essential
2005-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	computer > system configuration > login screen setup (user's password for gksudo)
2005-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	magnon		at least that's some of it
2005-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	Ah, I'm not a Gnome-er.
2005-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	security > allow root to login with gsm
2005-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	apokryphos		I'll login into Gnome in a bit, though, if it'll be easier there
2005-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	security > allow root to login with gDm
2005-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	Oh, not so long. I'll make a note of it. Thanks :)
2005-02-24T10:46:00.000Z	benjanet	magnon	thanks :p
2005-02-24T10:46:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	security > allow root to login *remotely* with gsm is probably something to *avoid* btw
2005-02-24T10:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	What would that entail?, I only plan on enabling it, really, so that I can run programs (if I want) as root from my own user (using Konsole).
2005-02-24T10:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	those are two checkmarks on the graphical configuration utility.  the bottom of the two is the more-dangerous, allowing remote attack a bit more
2005-02-24T10:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	Right, I'll try it now.
2005-02-24T10:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	if you're using kdm rather than gdm, there may be an equivalent setup util, i just don't know it myself
2005-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	ziggity		ok.. I need to get the synaptic manger on warty working so's I can load the monoDevelop IDE.. HELP Please

2005-02-24T10:55:00.000Z	audiored		hello all.. I have a question about installing guifications for gaim.  i've followed all the directions on the forums and it still isn't working for me.  anyone that could help me figure out what i'm doing wrong?, hello?
2005-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	eyequeue		what are quifications?
2005-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	audiored		it's a plugin for gaim, gives a bubble notification when you have a msg from someone
2005-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	FR500		hello
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	devo		hey, FR500
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	FR500		i get this error during an installation, *** X libraries or include files not found. Check 'config.log' for, *** more details., what do i need?
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	edulix		hi !
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	ziggity		ok when I try the synaptic manager for monodevelop it finds nothing. Why
2005-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	devo		I've got a no sound problem with Kaffeine at the moment.  The movie trailers pop up and run the video smoothly but no sound comes out.  Any suggestions?
2005-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	It didn't work... :(, Didn't seem to change anything
2005-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	apokryphos	perhaps you are using kdm rather than gdm, which that configures?
2005-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	apokryphos		I am ;-)
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	eyequeue		i guess you'll need to find out how kde configures their kdm
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	I guess I'll have to enable GDM than
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	I know how, but the option isn't there for it.
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	devo	FR500	what does the config.log file say?
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	FR500		where can i paste?
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	eyequeue		while you're welcome to ask here, being a gnome-based desktop, you might find the answer faster in another channel (don't take that wrong)
2005-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	pepsi		http://www.pastebin.com
2005-02-24T11:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	I understand :), but I don't mind using GDM. It's prettier anyhow ;)
2005-02-24T11:04:00.000Z	FR500		http://www.pastebin.com/241509
2005-02-24T11:05:00.000Z	apokryphos	eyequeue	will just have to find out how to re-enable it ;)
2005-02-24T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue		heh

2005-02-24T11:08:00.000Z	saif		i am trying to install ubuntu for a friend of mine, he doesn't have anetwork card, so it give me an error that the network could not be configured, and then another error that a step failed in the installationa and i should go back to the menu to redo the failed step!
2005-02-24T11:08:00.000Z	devo	umarmung	I've got Kaffeine's plugin for quicktime installed and the player pops up nicely on movie trailer sites like Apples.  But there's no sound. Any tweeks that i should consider right off?
2005-02-24T11:08:00.000Z	FR500		no prob
2005-02-24T11:09:00.000Z	saif		i try going into partioining, i get the same error, nothing is working! must i have a network card to install ubuntu?
2005-02-24T11:09:00.000Z	umarmung	devo	i had this issue with totem-xine, i installed an older codec and everything went fine

2005-02-24T11:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	Pinguvin	Have you followed the instructinos for the "Restricted Formats" on the site?
2005-02-24T11:11:00.000Z	delltony		curious when hoary becomes final stable? is it gonna be recommended to do a clean install or an upgrade?
2005-02-24T11:11:00.000Z	saif		hehe, ok, a different error: Kernel Panic: no init found!, HELP!

2005-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	bascule	saif	you have installed ubuntu, or this is during the install?
2005-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	saif		this is before i even start the install!
2005-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	bascule		borked cdrom IMO
2005-02-24T11:16:00.000Z	saif	bascule	right at the start.

2005-02-24T11:17:00.000Z	bascule	saif	did you check the md5 of the disc before burning it?
2005-02-24T11:17:00.000Z	bascule	saif	it isn't a tiny machine mith an MSI crom is it?
2005-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	farruinn		I'm having the problem described at www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=8050 but the solution posted there didn't work. Anyone willing to help?
2005-02-24T11:18:00.000Z	saif	bascule	it's anormal machine, not tiny, and the disc is the one that i got from ubuntu ( official ) the motherboard is slotek and cpu amd
2005-02-24T11:19:00.000Z	bascule		no I meant Tiny the PC manufacturer, perhaps they only exist in europe
2005-02-24T11:19:00.000Z	devo	bascule	no dice with the ffmpeg install.  still no sound.
2005-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	bascule		VIA chipset I assume ..
2005-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	bascule	saif	^
2005-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	saif	bascule	oh, nop never heard of it, it's not the tiny pc manufacturer, nor is it Tiny! :) yes, VIA

2005-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	bascule	GammaRay	there is always one, plug 4 USB devices into it, back and front, watch it cry ... :P

2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	evarlast	marccd	apt-get install php4-mysql
2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	farruinn	marccd	it's best not to mix ubuntu and debian repos, they're like oil and vinegar
2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	macewan		I use it at work - no problems
2005-02-24T11:24:00.000Z	saif		well, i donno, i added the universe repos and the apt-get, donno which repository did it though!

2005-02-24T11:51:00.000Z	bascule		<-- tempted to say something horrible
2005-02-24T11:51:00.000Z	devo	bascule	i'm just trying to get the movie trailers up.  i don't have religion on what does it.
2005-02-24T11:51:00.000Z	zenrox	raydoo_	ask away
2005-02-24T11:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	raydoo_	No!! Why, of course you can. =)
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	spinifex		I've got the default install of gnome on hoary.  When I hit logout, it freezes up my 'applications/places/desktop' bar, and waits about 5 minutes before asking me what type of logout I want to do
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	raydoo_		i just installed ubuntu, when it was finisied i changed my username ^^, now i cant sudo anymore

2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	bascule	devo	nor me, try this one in a console mplayer -cache 500 -playlist some.usr.you.want
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	raydoo_	You're no longer the primary user. You'll have to configure the new user to be one, to be able to sudo etc..
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	spinifex	raydoo_	can you still login the old account?
2005-02-24T11:52:00.000Z	delltony		question, whats the command line for alsamixer to raise the volume i'm trying to configure lineakd to raise my pcm volume

2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	GammaRay	raydoo_	take a look at /etc/sudoers as your old user. duplicate the line w/ your old user, but w/ your new user
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	raydoo_		and iam no longer in sudo list
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	delltony	in Terminal, type "alsamixer". Can change it in there.
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	raydoo_		ok lets look
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	delltony		yeah but i need the command as in aumix -w +5 or whatever
2005-02-24T11:53:00.000Z	sladen	GammaRay	in that case, boot into '(recovery mode)' and then edit it

2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	spinifex	bascule	how can he do that without root priveleges?
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	fallker		hey all
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	bestadvocate	tweek_	it would be nice if beagle could enter its results into googles homepage, just like desktop search, then we would have a fully open source solution,  best of both worlds
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	bascule		mplayer -cache 500 some.usr.you.want
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	bascule	spinifex	oh yeah, damn ..
2005-02-24T11:58:00.000Z	jba		hey guys, is there a planet.ubuntu.org or something?
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	bestadvocate		jba:?
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	tweek_		cool
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	ssamf		can someone running hoary try something for me? run "gthumb /" from the comandline, it is consistantly crashing for me
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	jba		like with planet.gnome.org,
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	bascule	raydoo_	you can only do it from a chroot in a livecd/other distro
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	jba		found it, planet.ubuntu.com
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	raydoo_		ah ok
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	spinifex		raydoo, looks like you're gonna have to hack your own computer.  or reinstall or something.
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	bestadvocate	ssamf	it crashed on me too
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	raydoo_		yep ^^
2005-02-24T11:59:00.000Z	sladen	bestadvocate	the way to do that is with a firefox plugin that hooks requests to www.google.*  ---have you suggested it as a wanted feature?
