2005-01-01T10:15:00.000Z	carlos	morning
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	carlos	spiv: ?
2005-01-01T12:11:00.000Z	jordi	carlos: time for almuerzo dude
2005-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	carlos	jordi: that's in your case, not in mine :-)
2005-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	jordi	:)
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	daf	wow, database/schema/Makefile hurts my eyes
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	carlos	daf: why?
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	daf	it's pretty hairy
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	daf	I'm glad I don't have to maintain that
2005-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	carlos	:-P
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	daf	carlos: "aleatory"?
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	carlos	daf: ?

2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	carlos	daf: random O:-)
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	daf	es? :)
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	carlos	my spanglish, you know
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	daf	ah :)
2005-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	daf	en_ES :)
2005-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	carlos	yeah :-P
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	carlos	daf: are you going to fix it?
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	carlos	or should I do it?
2005-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	daf	I'll do it
2005-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	daf	carlos: don't use "if type(x) is Foo"
2005-01-01T02:46:00.000Z	carlos	daf: why?
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	daf	if you must do type checking, always use "if isinstance(x, Foo)"
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	carlos	daf: I think Steve said we should use it instead of isinstance
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	daf	really?
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	carlos	daf: remember the proxy thing
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	daf	hmm
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	daf	are file uploads security-proxied?
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	carlos	if you use isinstance you get a proxy object instance instead of what you want
2005-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	carlos	daf: no idea
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	dilys	Merge to rocketfuel@canonical.com/launchpad--devel--0: fix bug with losing languages parameter from URLs (patch-1132, daf@canonical.com)
2005-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	salgado	jblack, is there something I can do in case a merge --two-way fails with "PANIC: unable to fork for hook"?
2005-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	daf	salgado: this is a bug in baz
2005-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	daf	salgado: perhaps you can use "baz merge --star-merge --two-way"?
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	salgado	daf, yeah, I've seen the bug, and this is why I tried the --two-way. 
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	salgado	I'm going to try with --star-merge now
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	salgado	daf, https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4756
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	salgado	isn't this?
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	daf	oh, right
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	daf	I got the error when executing the hook, not when running diff
2005-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	daf	thanks
2005-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	dilys	Merge to rocketfuel@canonical.com/launchpad--devel--0: various changes to the translation page (patch-1133, daf@canonical.com)

2005-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	salgado	daf, running with --star-merge --two-way worked for you?
2005-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	daf	"baz merge --star-merge" worked for me
2005-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	daf	I didn't use --two-way

2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	lamont	thanks
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: hi
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: now that malone is open to the world, could we use it to track the rosetta's bugs?
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	sabdfl	carlos: good idea!
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: what should be done?
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	carlos	just create a Rosetta product and that's all?
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	sabdfl	carlos: create a project called "The Launchpad"
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	sabdfl	then create products for malone and rosetta
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	carlos	ok
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	sabdfl	so we can file bugs against them there
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	sabdfl	we can use the dogfood server for security-related bugs till we have a security bug tracking feature in malone
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: should we add a link to malone at the main launchpad web page?
2005-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	jordi	hola people
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	carlos	jordi: hey
2005-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	carlos	ok, it's ready
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	jordi	carlos: do I need a separate malone account?
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	carlos	no
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	jordi	ok
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	carlos	jordi: same account
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	jordi	as it insists in telling me to "join"
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	carlos	?
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	carlos	ohh, that link...
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	carlos	it's broken at the moment...
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	carlos	so don't worry about it
2005-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	sabdfl	jordi!
2005-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	sabdfl	carlos: yes please, just a small one :-)
2005-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: could we "kill" the join link ?
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	carlos	the foaf part of launchpad is closed and I think it will confuse the userd
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	carlos	/s/userd/users/
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	jordi	hi mark!
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	jordi	hey, I got #3 :)
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	jordi	carlos: now, go fix! :)
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	jordi	tell me if that was the correct product/whatever. It's not trivial: the "full list" link does a popup, but it doesn't show anything.
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	carlos	jordi: dude, you have an entry box with a search button ;-)
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	jordi	which shows nothing, no matter what I input
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	jordi	I mean
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	jordi	I try to search for rosetta and the button doesn't appear to do anything. It's as if it didn't do anything.
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	carlos	jordi: it works here...
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	carlos	I typed "rosetta"  and did a submit
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	carlos	and I got:
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	carlos	rosetta
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	carlos	The Rosetta Translation Portal 
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	jordi	hmm
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	jordi	I... I assure you it wsn't working.
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	jordi	I tried 3 times.
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	carlos	URL?
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	carlos	https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/malone/bugs/+product
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	carlos	from there and using (list) link works here
2005-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	jordi	carlos: yeah, I'm saying it works now.
2005-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	carlos	jordi: what changed?
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	jordi	carlos: who knows.
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	carlos	aarrrrggg
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	carlos	I have lost some code because a conflict and I didn't noticied it, baz does NOT works yet as cvs/svn merging conflicts
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bob2	the dailies do
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	bob2	you can't commit until they resolved
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: my version is from last week
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: and baz redo
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	carlos	told me about a conflict
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	carlos	but the file didn't had any mark so I thought it was an error on baz
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	carlos	and resolved the conflict and removed the .rej and .orig
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	carlos	and I suppose that I have lost that change
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	bob2	how did you lose code if it didn't have conflict markers?
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: because I know that the code was there but it's not now
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: a bug in baz?
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	bob2	could be...
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	bob2	the actual file contents diffing is done by the regular diff program, tho...

2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	carlos	and got a conflict (because other local changes I did before remembered the baz undo thing)
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	bob2	oh
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: only the part that conflicted

2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	carlos	removed by hand some changes (seems like I forgot some of them)
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	carlos	redo
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	carlos	conflict due some local changes were still there
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	carlos	and I lost the conflict code from the undo directory
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	hm
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	oh
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	redo will not have made <<<<<-style conflict markers
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	carlos	right, the file does not have such markers
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	right
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	so if you got conflicts, then deleted the .mod and .orig files, tthen you've lost data :/
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: I know :-(
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	carlos	I thought that they were useless
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	does this sound like what happened?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: yeah
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	ah
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	hm
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	wouldd it make more sense to you if redo produced 3-way-style markers?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: don't know how they look like
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	the <<<< ones
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	in the file
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	carlos	yeah
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	carlos	that's what I expected
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	carlos	that's why I removed the .orig and .rej files
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	right
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	carlos	because usualy the .rej is empty (with a message that you should look at the file)
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	file a bug asking that redo do that then? :)
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	yeah
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	carlos	ok
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: are you using malone now?
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	especially now that -t is the default for star-merge, it's confusing that redo does not
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	erm, I don't know
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	bob2	I know we were going to switch at some point, but I on't know if we did
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: it's open to the public atm
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	carlos	so I suppose that it depends on you to use it for bazaar
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	carlos	we are going to use it for Rosetta as soon as I send the announcement tonight
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	bob2	oh, cool
2005-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	bob2	no bugs on bazaar in it yet, I'll wait for robert or brad to tell me it's ready to roll, I think
2005-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	carlos	bob2: brad is on holidays
2005-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	ah
2005-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	so is robert
2005-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	jblack	bob2!
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	jblack	Yeah. I don't believe redo isn't doing three way yet.
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	elmo	stub/spiv: around ?
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	elmo	jblack: ?
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	jblack	Yeah? 
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	elmo	jblack: I need to reboot production and devel supermirror - ok?
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	jblack	checking
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	jblack	go ahead
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	elmo	thanks, rebooting
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	jblack	it won't hurt devel if you reboot it whenever you like.
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	jblack	on production, the only thing you need to watch out for is whether or not tla is running
2005-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	jblack	Everything I write is lock safe, but tla itself isn't.
2005-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	elmo	okay, both back
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	jblack	thanks
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	salgado	hey stub. you haven't commited that patch for the preferred email and the temp email table, right?
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	wasabi	huh. i wonder if making xserver kick off dpkg-reconfigure on itself when it fails to start is a good idea.
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	wasabi	heh.
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	wasabi	!!! HACK !!!
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	bob2	how annoying
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	bob2	my laptop will only associate with my AP for about 20 seconds
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	bob2	then it drops
2005-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	yann_	hello :)
2005-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	yann_	any webmaster of ubuntulinux.org, or a way to contact one of theme? didn't get any answer to my mails :/
2005-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	yann_	we're creating a french support site for ubuntu, including a forum, would be nice if there could be a link in http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/forums/
2005-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	bob2	who did you email?
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	yann_	info & webmaster @ ubuntulinux.org
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	bob2	when?
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	yann_	the first about a month ago, the second about 2 weeks ago
2005-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	yann_	both were about a french site about ubuntu
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	yann_	12/13/2004 07:33 PM
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	yann_	from etheeten@gmail.com

2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	yann_	that was to trademarks@ubuntulinux.org
2005-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	yann_	the first mail is from 11/30/2004 01:54 AM , to info@ubuntulinux.org, from yann@mandragor.org
2005-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	yann_	does that help? :|
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	yann_	well, do you think I should try to mail again? :/
2005-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	bob2	hm, no cds yet
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	bob2	mako: if the cds claimed to have shipped on nov 8th, but aren't here yet, is it time to start wondering?
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	calc	wow that is a while
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	calc	i got mine back at thanksgiving
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	bob2	daniels: my X laptop gets very unhappy when I start a second X server
2005-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	wasabi	I still haven't gotten mine either.
2005-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	wasabi	CD's that is.
2005-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	bob2	have you checked shipit.ubuntu.com?
2005-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	kergan	how long does it take on average
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	depends on when you order
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	they go out in bunches
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	kergan	i orderd them aroung turkey day
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	kergan	and not it finaly told me thay sent them on the 6th of this month
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	bob2	should be there very soon then
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	kylem	bob2, i've the same problem. (same ship date too)
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	kergan	2 weeks
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	kergan	really
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	kergan	wow thats fast specaly since its the x-mas malling seasion
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	calc	they are shipped from switzerland i think
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	calc	so probably takes a while
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	fabbione	morning
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	calc	fabbione: hi
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	doko	morning all
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	fabbione	hey doko
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	fabbione	doko: we need a 64bit gcc for ppc
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	doko	fabbione: see on chinstrap:~doko/gcc/
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	fabbione	sw33t
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	fabbione	why isn't uploaded?
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	doko	it's C only, we don't a 64bit glibc, no priority, ...
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	fabbione	doko: we need the gcc for the 64bit kernel :-)
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	fabbione	the rest can wait
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	fabbione	doko: we will need a very minimal amount of packages in 64 bit
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	calc	just buy an x86-64 ;)
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	fabbione	like gcc, libc, ncurses and something like sparc-utils
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	calc	does ubuntu work on g5's already?
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	fabbione	calc: our buildd are g5
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	calc	cool
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	fabbione	but they are running UP/32bit
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	calc	oh
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	fabbione	because of kernel limitations
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	calc	that kinda sucks, wasting half of the system then
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	calc	is it numa like amd64?
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	fabbione	that's why we need gcc 64bit & so on...
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	fabbione	no idea...
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	fabbione	i am not into ppc at all
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	calc	oh ok
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	fabbione	i just need to prepare the kernel for elmo to test at the datacenter :)
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	doko	32bit apps on ppc are usually faster.
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	fabbione	doko: it is like sparc
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	calc	32bit is usually faster in general except when you have a braindead arch like x86
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	fabbione	64bit kernel, 32 bit userland
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	fabbione	and only a few userland packages in 64bit
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	fabbione	like pgsql and stuff like that
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	calc	a 32bit x86-64 would be interesting
2005-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	calc	i wonder if it would be even faster (if its even possible to force it into such a mode)
2005-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	fabbione	installing on 9600bps serial console is the pain
2005-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	wasabi	dont suppose anybody who knows much about preseeding base-config is awake
2005-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	fabbione	wasabi: just ask
2005-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	wasabi	Well.... trying to find the right preseeding values to get hoary's base-config to skip everything.
2005-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	wasabi	Tried everything I can and it's still asking for username, passwor,d and showing the welcome and timezone screens
2005-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	fabbione	wasabi: preseeding isn't always enough
2005-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	fabbione	you need to workaround some debconf priorities as well
2005-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	wasabi	Hmmm.
2005-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	wasabi	Well, not sure how to adjust the priorities of base-config, which is started automatically.
2005-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	fabbione	you need to edit the scripts
2005-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	wasabi	the base-config scripts?
2005-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	fabbione	yes
2005-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	wasabi	nuh.
2005-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	wasabi	buh.
2005-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	wasabi	that's not easy. =/
2005-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	fabbione	i never said it was :)
2005-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	wasabi	I was just hoping.
2005-01-01T07:37:00.000Z	wasabi	It should be easier.
2005-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	wasabi	So, there a howto? ;0
2005-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	fabbione	just read the code? ;)
2005-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	wasabi	=(

2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	pitti	Hi mvo
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	mvo	hi pitti 
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	sid77	hi
2005-01-01T09:43:00.000Z	pitti	Hi seb128 
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	"seb128 broke my gnome" ?
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	morning
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	(mataro server)
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks: hum ?
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128: why did I have to rm ~/.gnome2/session to make my panel work again? :)
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	seb128	"seb128 broke your panel"
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128: and nautilus.. I couldn't right-click on the desktop either
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks: killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus gnome-panel trashapplet
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	seb128	nothing to do with the session
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	seb128	that's a gnome-vfs-daemon bug
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128: removing the session fixed it for me
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	seb128	no
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	seb128	restarting fixed it
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	seb128	no ?
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	seb128	the bug doesn't happen every time
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128: no, I tried to log in 3 times -- each time the panel "hung".. removing the session file -> it worked again
2005-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128: so that was a coincidence?
2005-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	seb128	yep
2005-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	seb128	you have kept the session ?
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Treenaks	I moved it aside instead of rm'ing it, so yes
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Treenaks	not that I used it for anything but starting gaim.. but hey
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	seb128	you can retry to put it again and see if it bugs
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	Treenaks	tonight, when I'm with the machine again :)
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	seb128	ok
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	seb128	if the session is broken open a bug with it :)
2005-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	seb128	brrr
2005-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	seb128	-9C according to my weather

2005-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	pitti	mvo: seriously, this is not trivial in Warty
2005-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	pitti	mvo: the easiest solution is probably to add an fstab entry
2005-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	mvo	pitti: aye, thanks#

2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	fabbione	nevermind
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	fabbione	i am on crack
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	Kamion	pitti: yo
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: i did bootstrap the sparc :-)
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Kamion	cool
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fabbione	plenty of problems, but nothing unfixable
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fabbione	for some reasons d-i installed a -smp kernel (=kabuum)
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Kamion	that's easy to sort out
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	fabbione	and it didn't find silo-installer or couldn't install silo for some reasons
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	fabbione	and it did add restricted to sources.list
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	fabbione	that's another kabuum
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	fabbione	probably 2 of them are related
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	Kamion	not really interested in kludging the restricted thing for sparc only; fix your archive :)
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: well... there is nothing restricted for sparc...
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	Kamion	for the rest, can you send me /var/log/debian-installer/syslog from the installed system?
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	fabbione	but yeah...
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	fabbione	i will fix my archive
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	Kamion	sure, but d-i doesn't get to know that
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	fabbione	sure i can
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	Kamion	the silo thing is weird
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	fabbione	it might be something wrong on the archive... i didn't spend too much time on it
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Kamion	oh, *crap*, silo-installer is RETARDED
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Kamion	ok, that's silo-installer brokenness which needs to be fixed
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: oh.. ok
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	Kamion	unfortunately it means a string change
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: hmmm
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	Kamion	it might be easier to kludge it by unexcluding silo from debootstrap for now
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: no rush....
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	fabbione	it is more important to get the correct kernel
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	fabbione	at least in the beginning
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: what does the 'ncpus probed' line in /proc/cpuinfo look like?
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	fabbione	ncpus probed    : 1
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	fabbione	this is with 2.6.8 from debian
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: hm, is linux-sparc64 in your archive?
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Kamion	it's in restricted ... :)
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: the most important thing is that i need to figure why the console hangs at the end of the boot process
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fabbione	isn't that from linux-meta?
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Kamion	actually it might not be in restricted, haven't checked
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Kamion	yes
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	mako	bob2: yeah, it may be a problem.. i am making a list of probably borked cds
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	mako	bob2: shipments that is.. i'll be contacting the companya bout them
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	fabbione	linux-sparc64_2.6.9-4_sparc.deb
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	mako	bob2: i have a half a dozen now
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: i get this in main
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Kamion	hm
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Kamion	/var/log/debian-installer/syslog definitely needed to debug
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fabbione	i did send you the mail....
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fabbione	did you get it?
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Kamion	haven't read mail yet this morning
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fabbione	ah ok
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	fabbione	take your time
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fabbione	i need to go and cut my hairs
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fabbione	+ the buildd is catching up
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fabbione	all that lsb-* is crap on console :-)
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	fabbione	it looks really really really hugly
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	seb128	doko: here ?
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	wasabi	waaaah
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	Kamion	wasabi: you know that the username/password stuff is in shadow not base-config, right?
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	wasabi	i can't even get the welcoem screen to go away.
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	wasabi	but no, i didn't.
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Kamion	# Avoid the introductory message.
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Kamion	base-config     base-config/intro       note
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Kamion	does that not work?
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	wasabi	i have that, and no.
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	# Skip the two initial welcome screens.
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	base-config     base-config/title       title
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	base-config     base-config/intro       note
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	base-config     base-config/login       note
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	i've got those.
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	s/two/three
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	heh
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	s/two// =/
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Kamion	title isn't a question anyway
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	wasabi	yeah i just saw it in debconf-get-selections and figured i'd give it a try
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	Kamion	would probably be easiest to figure out how to get base-config's debconf priority to critical
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	wasabi	so the passwd stuff is shadow now, not passwd?
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	wasabi	the manual says passwd.
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Kamion	might require adding a base-config/priority template for preseeding; I was ordered to stop Ubuntu copying debconf/priority from the first stage
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	wasabi	or something does, or i wouldn't have done it.
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Kamion	passwd is from the shadow source package; sure, passwd
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	wasabi	i dont know enough about templates and stuff yet.
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	wasabi	im just a user trying to deploy ubuntu today
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	Kamion	I'm at least partially talking to myself ... :)
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	wasabi	if i can get this working, fai is going to die an ugly death
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	wasabi	because i like this much better.
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Kamion	ok, how about I add base-config/priority for you now in 2.60ubuntu4
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	wasabi	for obvious reasons.
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	wasabi	sounds good!
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	wasabi	Yeah I like the idea of having a seperate setting for base-config
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	wasabi	could be useful in certain circumstances.
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	ajmitch_	morning
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	Kamion	jdub: can I add silo to base for sparc?
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	wasabi	Kamion: are you making that change now or later? just wondering so I can stop paying attention tonight.
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: aha, you and ia64 share a bug, found it and am fixing now
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	Kamion	wasabi: right after this fix for Fabio
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	wasabi	you dont' have to worry about it
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	Kamion	I think it's important though
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	wasabi	oh okay. ;)
2005-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	Kamion	lamont: tomorrow's CD should fix the ia64 kernel brokenness
2005-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	Kamion	(in d-i)
2005-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	Kamion	wasabi: uploaded. when you see base-config_2.60ubuntu4_all.deb in the archive, try 'base-config base-config/priority select critical'
2005-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	wasabi	super. You rock.
2005-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	wasabi	thank you drive thru
2005-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	Kamion	untested though :)
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	wasabi	fun
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	mvo	Kamion: is the hoary i386-cdimage of today safe to use? 
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	Kamion	mvo: no idea, probably not
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	Kamion	mvo: it includes python2.4-minimal and so needs a debootstrap update, which I'm doing now
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	mvo	is there a date that you can recommend :) ?
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Kamion	20041220 would be my first guess but I haven't tried it
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	mvo	ah, thanks
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	mvo	I'll give it a try then. I need a current cd to test upgrading from it 
2005-01-01T12:32:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: cool.. what was the bug?
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	fabbione	whoops :-)
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	fabbione	i can see from the changes ;)
2005-01-01T12:55:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: is there a ppc or i386 dchroot somewhere with kernel build-deps?
2005-01-01T12:56:00.000Z	fabbione	yup
2005-01-01T12:56:00.000Z	fabbione	ppc davis
2005-01-01T12:57:00.000Z	pitti	cool, thanks
2005-01-01T12:57:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: i386 somewhere?
2005-01-01T12:57:00.000Z	fabbione	i386.. hmm probably macaroni
2005-01-01T12:57:00.000Z	fabbione	otherwise send me the diff and i will build it for you
2005-01-01T12:58:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: I don't need a full build to start with; I will probably trim down the .config for my host and test there
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: I would like to start with the PaX kernel
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: ah i see
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	fabbione	good luck :-)
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: thanks!
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: btw, SSP really rocks
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: eheheh
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	fabbione	you are a security bitch
2005-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: basically, with SSP you can forget about buffer overflow USNs
2005-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	fabbione	yeah i was there for you taking notes man
2005-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	pitti	I know
2005-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	fabbione	"Why don't we chroot X?"
2005-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	pitti	but now I saw it in action
2005-01-01T01:00:00.000Z	pitti	and digged through the theory
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: it seems that I don't have access to macaroni
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: you need to talk with elmo
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: anyway, let's start with ppc then
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: I do when he returns
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	fabbione	otherwise send me the stuff i will build here
2005-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	Kamion	stupid pile of shit deliberately throws away all errors generated about the .changes
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	wasabi	Kamion: priority looks good... somehow I can't find the choice to get past the tiemzone. Asking for the Eastern, Central, etc.
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	wasabi	base-config     tzconfig/choose_contry_zone/US  select  Central
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	Kamion	you've misspelled country there
2005-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	wasabi	HAHA
2005-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	wasabi	ohh geeze
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	wasabi	heh. im at work now... been doing server upgrades all night
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	wasabi	I've been awake 24 hours. Forgive me.
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Kamion	np :)
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	sid77	hi
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	fabbione	the kernel package is insane
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	fabbione	i am not sure i want to redo it from scratch
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	pitti	seb128: you broke the panel again!!!
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	pitti	seb128: I get bombarded with neverending error dialogs
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	pitti	seb128: :-)
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	seb128	arf
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	AndyFitz	okay this is silly.  and I have no idea how to resolve the problem.  gnome doesnt load and all that is shown is the panel position ( left blank ) and the desktops background colour ( not image )
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	AndyFitz: apparently logging in a few times fixes it
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	AndyFitz	I thought it was gconfd  because even on new user accounts it happens
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	Treenaks	no then it's gnome-vfs-daemon
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	AndyFitz	sorry ill move this to #ubuntu
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	Treenaks	AndyFitz: no, just poke seb128 :)
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	seb128	killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus gnome-panel trashapplet
2005-01-01T01:49:00.000Z	AndyFitz	I've gone as far as to create new user acounts and also to completely reinstall gnome entirely
2005-01-01T01:49:00.000Z	AndyFitz	seb128: it must be gnome-session  
2005-01-01T01:49:00.000Z	AndyFitz	because I can load xfce4 fine 
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, hey
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	AndyFitz	and from there 'sometimes'  I can loat gnome-panel  
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	AndyFitz	hiya usual
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, havn't seen ya in a while on gaim.
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	usual	doh I got a new screenname, maybe thats why
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	AndyFitz	usual, I've been online on jabber icq irc aol msn etc etc 
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, yea, I forgot I changed my screenname
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, hows it goin
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	AndyFitz	good but something broke my gnome :P
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	usual	what happens?
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	AndyFitz	see above
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	usual	ahh
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, are your panels there but blank?
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	AndyFitz	yep
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	AndyFitz	but only sometimes
2005-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	AndyFitz	I think if I've uses sudo recently they seem to work   although I'm not sure
2005-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, it happened to me too yesterday and the day before, but it seems fine now
2005-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	AndyFitz	uses = used 
2005-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, I nuked the .hastodowithgnomedir's and it seemed to have helped
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	AndyFitz	I already tried nuking them
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	AndyFitz	the problem came back
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	usual	:(
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	AndyFitz	it was fixed for one login 
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, hows the icon set coming btw
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	usual	looks good
2005-01-01T01:57:00.000Z	AndyFitz	usual, thanks I'm reworking them to suit  brisgeek.com/etiquette/
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, full set for gnome?
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	AndyFitz	andy.fitzsimon.com.au/etiquette-icons.tar.gz  is there but very incomplete
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, I came across your site for it the other day on gnome-look.org, I like it all but the metacity theme
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	AndyFitz	usual:  theres over 2,000 icons in whats considered a full set for gnome :-/  and I keep changing styles / xml rules 
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	usual	ah
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	AndyFitz	the metacity theme I have in the gimp screenshot ? 
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	AndyFitz	its also here http://andy.fitzsimon.com.au/icons.png 
2005-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	haggai	pitti: pong :)
2005-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	AndyFitz	the hover state for the buttons shows their type
2005-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	usual	yea, it looks alot better in thie shot
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, can't wait to give them a try
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	usual	nice trashcan
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	AndyFitz	roberTO did that for the milk gtk theme  I really like it yeah but was going to make my own pixmap based gtk theme first before considering what metacity to use
2005-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	usual	k
2005-01-01T02:04:00.000Z	AndyFitz	usual, download and check them out now ,  I'm currently using them at 16x16 on my gnome-panel, they were designed to scale below my other stuff
2005-01-01T02:04:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, are they avilible somewhere
2005-01-01T02:04:00.000Z	AndyFitz	andy.fitzsimon.com.au/etiquette-icons.tar.gz
2005-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	AndyFitz	should work
2005-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	fabbione	bob2: the BenH patch doesn't even compile
2005-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	usual	got em

2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	AndyFitz	the default size is 48x48 like normal pixmap icons.   lila, gartoon and the industrial gnome-vfs icons  are all 92x92 I think
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	Kamion	that's odd, it compiled fine for me
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	usual	AndyFitz, wierd, I put them in the icon folder, it shows the icon in the theme app, but no icons changed
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	robtaylor	hey, is hoary working enough now that its worth upgrading to?
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	usual	robtaylor, I use it daily with little trouble
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	robtaylor	usual: cool, upgrade it is then ;)
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: i am using -7.diff on davis...
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	AndyFitz	usual: that happens sometimes with gnome-themes-manager ,  next login they will work
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	usual	ok
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	usual	brb
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: which flavour is failing?
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	fabbione	power3
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	fabbione	at least...
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	Kamion	DSSALL is used in other places in arch/ppc/
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	fabbione	this is the first one that gets to build
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	fabbione	yes i know.. but they don't get compiled on power3 apparently
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	Kamion	best ask benh I suspect
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	mvo	ping doko
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	fabbione	yeah.. they don't get compiled
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	fabbione	probably is just an ifdef somewhere
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo_away: please sync groff 1.18.1.1-5 from Debian
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	pitti	Kamion: sorry for the groff upload; I worked through a modem yesterday and didn't bother to check sid again
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Kamion	np
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: can you confirm that the patch is used only by power4 ?
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: deny
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	Kamion	power4 != G4
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	fabbione	(for what is my understanding of ppc arch anyway)
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	Kamion	I don't know if it should be used only by the powerpc flavours; it contains a number of other updates beyond just sleep so I'd be wary of making that assumption
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: how can i identify that via CONFIG_* in the kernel?
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	Kamion	don't try, ask benh to fix it :)
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: the other changes are more generic
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	Kamion	I know
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	fabbione	and they compile (therefor they can be shipped) on all the other arches
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	fabbione	;)
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	pitti	so it compiles, it ... ?
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	Kamion	CONFIG_6xx is the kernel used on most powerpc systems, including G4 laptops
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	Kamion	G5 systems are CONFIG_POWER4
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	Kamion	I would imagine we'll see PowerBook G5 systems in a year or two
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	fabbione	hopefully in one year or two all this extra patching won't be required 
2005-01-01T02:23:00.000Z	fabbione	it looks like that only power3 doesn't have that DSSALL
2005-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: where's DSSALL defined?
2005-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: ENOCLUE
2005-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	fabbione	it looks like something in binutils
2005-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	fabbione	grep doesn't return anything useful
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	srbaker	anyone know of squeak packages for ubuntu?
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	srbaker	or, even squeak for debian that i could recompile?
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	squeak?
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: same one, or cooler one? :P)
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Simira	squeak, Treenaks 
2005-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	srbaker	smalltalk environment
2005-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	Simira	Treenaks: cooler, of course. The old one isn't in sale anymore
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	srbaker	grrrr.
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	srbaker	need /etc/apt/sources.list.d
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	Treenaks	srbaker: submit a patch
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	srbaker	Treenaks, i intend to as soon as i move
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	srbaker	it's on my tomboy list :P
2005-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	srbaker	speaking of which, i need hoary packages for f-spot and tomboy.
2005-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	srbaker	anyone know?
2005-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	mvo	srbaker: there is a patch in the bts for /etc/apt/sources.list.d. we'll get it eventually :)
2005-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	srbaker	okay.  so now the only thing i need to increase my productivity is moisturizing cream that doesn't make my hands feel greasy
2005-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	mvo	srbaker: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=66325
2005-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	srbaker	cool
2005-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	robtaylor	carlos: had time to look at accessd yet??
2005-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	robtaylor	pitti: would you like to take a look?
2005-01-01T03:10:00.000Z	pitti	robtaylor: I'm in a bit of a hurry right now
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	pitti	robtaylor: but in general I'd like to look at it
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	Kamion	Keybuk: signkey uses "$name's" in a couple of places, which in Perl is the same as $name::s
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	Kamion	Keybuk: care to fix that to ${name}'s?
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	pitti	robtaylor: is there a tarball/pdf/whatever to look at?
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	robtaylor	pitti: no rush, but when you're not busy let me know and i'll take you through it
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	pitti	robtaylor: a guided tour? That'll be nice! :-)
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Kamion	Keybuk: (or $name\'s)
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	robtaylor	pitti: http://sourcecontrol.net/~rtaylor/ has accessd and dbus packages with extra python bindings
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	robtaylor	s/accessd/my accessd arch repo mirror/
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	srbaker	how do i completely disable OSS?
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	pitti	Hi trulux
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: I tried your ssp packages. Rock!
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: it is really cool
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: to actually put it into Hoary, I'd like to see two things:
2005-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: 1) rename the packages to *-ssp
2005-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: 2) modify the gcc-ssp-3.4 wrapper program to include the necessary settings (-lssp and -fstack-protector)
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: otherwise I played around with it a little, looks nice
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	lamont	Kamion: you around?
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	trulux	hey pitti
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	lamont	seb128: around?
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	seb128	lamont: yep
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, why the name change? nothing is different (in usability terms)
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	Kamion	what's this total python b0rkage?
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	Kamion	/bin/sh: /usr/bin/mklibs: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	trulux	the warpper is (almost) ready
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	jdahlin	what's up with archive.u.c?
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	trulux	just needs packaging
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: because we already have such a source and binary package? (and, btw, a newer one)
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, i can send you the patches
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	trulux	in order to get the stuff without pain in newerr versions
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	Kamion	trulux: we can't just drop something straight into hoary without seeing how it works elsewhere first
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	trulux	what do you think?
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	Kamion	a separate package for the meantime is extremely useful.
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	Kamion	otherwise you're asking a great deal of faith from us
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: and it would be cool to integrate -lssp and -fstack-protector into the wrapper, so that these do not need to be specified explicitly
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, that could be done in an easy way
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: the plan is to have completely separate packages for a while
2005-01-01T03:21:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: and when they prove good and we are reasonable sure to 1) not break anything and 2) we have a chance of sustainable support, then we can talk about putting them into main
2005-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: oh: and gcc-ssp packages should depend on libssp-dev
2005-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, yes
2005-01-01T03:22:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: thanks! see you later
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, i will send you the patches
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	trulux	Kamion, anyway, i did the stuff in the way i thought it's the best
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	trulux	and non-enabled by default is the best way
2005-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	trulux	i must go too
2005-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	srbaker	is it possible to comppletely disable OSS?
2005-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	yann__	hi
2005-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	yann__: if you find them, tell me how you did it :)
2005-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	yann__: I might need it for the Dutch site :)
2005-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	yann__	didn't they answer to your emails either ? 
2005-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	yann__	Treenaks  > let's see your website :)
2005-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	yann__: www.ubuntulinux.nl and www.ubuntu-linux.nl (run by the same guy, need to be integrated)
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	tim1	hello
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	tim1	is this the right channel to discuss rosetta ?
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	sivang	tim1: theres a rosetta chaneel :)
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	sivang	tim1: join #rosetta
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	mako	Kamion, elmo_away: so theoretically, there is a community council meetining today, right?
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: apparently, it will be just me and you
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	sivang	mako: also wondered about that :)
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	mako	elmo seems away and sabdfl as well
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	mako	well, there a couple country teams on the agenda
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	mako	and one more i suspect if sivang has anything to do with it
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	sivang	mako : yes :)
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	lamont	elmo is away
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	mako	lamont: do you know about sabdfl?
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: you around?
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	well, at least I'm here :)
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	lamont	no clue, but wouldn't surprise me, given his 'take some down time' comments at the conf
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	mako	i'm trying to decide if we have can go ahead with the meeting
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	mako	lamont: do you know elmo's story
2005-01-01T03:45:00.000Z	mako	lamont: basically, will he be back in 1.25h?
2005-01-01T03:46:00.000Z	lamont	doko!!
2005-01-01T03:47:00.000Z	yann__	Treenaks  > www.ubuntu-fr.org
2005-01-01T03:47:00.000Z	yann__	:)
2005-01-01T03:47:00.000Z	lamont	mako: dunno.  ISTR him saying something about a week of holiday right after the conf
2005-01-01T03:47:00.000Z	mako	hmm.. ok
2005-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	mako	well.. i can call mark and see if he's gonna be around at all this week
2005-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	mako	otherwise, this stuff will be put off until at least after new years
2005-01-01T03:49:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: it may be our chance to ram through otherwise controverisal proposal
2005-01-01T03:49:00.000Z	sivang	mako: I reckon most people need some time off after the conference, we could probably manage with only some brief discussions for country teams and others..
2005-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	yann__	Treenaks > how many mails did you sent? is it worth trying again? :)
2005-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	Treenaks	yann__: none yet, because the merging isn't done yet
2005-01-01T03:51:00.000Z	yann__	we've got a forum that's already open, the site is comnig soon... but still can't get in touch with ubuntu's team
2005-01-01T03:51:00.000Z	sivang	enrico: hi!
2005-01-01T03:52:00.000Z	enrico	sivang: hi!
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	Kamion	mako: hmm. does two out of four count as a majority?
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: yep, just came home
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	haggai	is Jane still on holiday?
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	Kamion	mako: elmo said he'd be away from tomorrow, which I took to mean that he'd be here today
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	mako	well, mark will l come
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	mako	i just talked to him on the phone
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	Kamion	ah, ok
2005-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	Keybuk	hmm, hal is working today.  yesterday it refused to play, today I get an "IAUDIO" window popping up.  strange thing, I think my camera actually kills it
2005-01-01T04:12:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: 
2005-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: want to prepare a short thing about country teams goals and such to present at the meeting
2005-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: i'm going to prepare a short summary from the nm bof
2005-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: I'll be at the meeting
2005-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: awesome.. i'll put an introduction on the agneda
2005-01-01T04:16:00.000Z	sivang	mako: are you going to discuss the NM process on the CC meeting?
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	zul	when is the meeting?
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	smurfix	OK, I'll say a few words about country team stuff then
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	smurfix	zul: 1600 UTC
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	yann__	\o/

2005-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	lamont	haggai: my understanding is that Jane is still on holiday.  she is checking email occasionally, apparently
2005-01-01T04:19:00.000Z	Treenaks	how long do these meetings take, usually?
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	sivang	Treenaks: hmm, that depends :)
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	minutes, hours, days, weeks
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	sivang	Treenaks: there have been ones that took more then 2 hours :)
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	sivang: I've heard of 5-minute ones
2005-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	sivang	Treenaks: there have beem, well, TB meetings tend to take much much longer.
2005-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	Kamion	shortest has been 15 minutes IIRC
2005-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	Treenaks	my boss won't like a >1hr one (closing down the building, setting the alarm and stuff :))
2005-01-01T04:23:00.000Z	zul	Treenaks: tell your boss to be patient :)
2005-01-01T04:23:00.000Z	Treenaks	zul: 8)
2005-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	mako	sivang: i'd like to 
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	haggai	lamont: thanks :)
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	mako	are there any NM's for the meeting that need CC approval
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	mako	haggai: did we approve you yet?
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	mako	or do we need to?
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	haggai	mako: yup, I'm all done
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	mako	good
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	mako: NMs or "ubuntites"? 
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	mako	there were a handful of people that raised their hand at the NM meeting
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	mako	Treenaks: sorry, "UBUNTITES"
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	mako: I was one of those :)
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	mako	we can add you to the list
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	OK, great
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	mako	Treenaks: actually, go add yourself :)
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	mako	CommunityCouncilAgenda
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	Treenaks	mako: hm, need to hack together a wiki page on myself then :)
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	Treenaks	probably
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	sivang	mako: development maintainers needs be approved by technical contribs right?
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	Kamion	sivang: by the tech board
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	sivang	Kamion: ah ok :)
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	ChrisH	mako: Did you find a chance to review the NM draft?
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	mako	ChrisH: sure.. it will have to be super quick
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: next time write "smurf" instead of misspelling my name please ;-)
2005-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	sivang	mako: could you reminde me what being an UBUNTITES mean? :)
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	mako	i spelled it right once and then mispelled it when i lost my change, i swear :)
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	lamont	fabbione: you around?
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	mako	sivang: basically you can vote and such but not upload packages
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	mako	sivang: i think you should put yourself down for that
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	mako	people with visible contributions to the community who want to be enfranchised
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	sivang	mako: ok, I'll go list my name there - already have a page :)
2005-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	sivang	mako: but there is not "new ubuntites" page :)
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	sivang: 1 second
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	mako	well, make one, it's a wiki after all :)
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	sivang	ok, let's rock it on! (as jdub says )
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	there's an entry on the agenda page now
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	sivang: edit now :)
2005-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	sivang	Treenaks: done:)
2005-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	sivang	mako: what about doc maintainership? is it the same like being a ubuntites?
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	mako	sivang: yes
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: i want that patch
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	Kamion	currently it's too horrible for words and hardcodes my key ... :)
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: package it up when you fix that :)
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Kamion	(well, keyid, anyway)
2005-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	smurfix	Kamion: So use $ENV{SIGN_KEYID} and complain if that's not set ;-)
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	mojo	can some ppl here confirm this bug for me: (not sure my mistake or bug)
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	mojo	I have a error msg in synaptic each time I update
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	mojo	[Invalid UTF-8]  Could not parse file '/usr/share/applications/ooo645calc.desktop':

2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	Mithrandir	mojo: it's a known issue
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	yann__	wow, if this is a place to report bugs, i got a bug in gthumb (warty) :)
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	Mithrandir	yann__: bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	yann__	Mithrandir > i know, i know :|
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	yann__	ok i'll try.
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	mojo	thx for the info, at least I know it's not my mistake
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	fabbione	lamont: now
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	fabbione	Kamion: the ibook thingy can compile only on 6xx
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	fabbione	so powerpc kernels
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	Kamion	ok
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: ping
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: will the next kernel build system include an animated colorful cartoon strip to make it more interesting?
2005-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: 
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: that in jap or chineese?
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	sivang	:)
2005-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: anyway, we still don't have an ubuntu-il mailing list :)
2005-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: That's "pong".
2005-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: also, do we already have anything for making derived distros wrt to locality?
2005-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: in what lang? :)
2005-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: Chinese of course.
2005-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: I dunno wo's responsible for the mailing lists, I just know it's not me ;-)
2005-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	smurfix	who's
2005-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: easily making derived distros is on the agends for post-hoary.
2005-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	Kamion	sigh, need to add python-minimal to debootstrap as well as python2.4-minimal now ...
2005-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	tseng	has anyone noticed problems with the security update login package in warty?
2005-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	tseng	google and gmane say no
2005-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: no, what do you mean?
2005-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	pitti	Hi elmo
2005-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	tseng	booting it gives me a big dump of cant execute /sbin/agetty
2005-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: Mark asked me to rename debstriptranslations to pkgstriptranslations
2005-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	tseng	then it respawns to fast, and init gives up completely
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: I guess that means that debstriptranslations will be removed and I upload a new package pktstriptranslations?
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: This is not a login problem
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	elmo	pitti: just upload the new package for now
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: this rather sounds like the udev race condition
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	elmo	preferably soon, as I'm on holiday from tomorrow on
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: oh =/
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: okay, I'll do
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: sometimes the text consoles just say byebye
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: BTW, we did not make a security update of 'login'. What do you mean in particular?
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	fabbione: hrm, ok
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	tseng	well i did a clean install of warty, then dist-upgrade from security, universe, and main
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	tseng	and it grabbed a new login
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: could you sync groff 1.18.1.1-5 from Debian please?
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: sorry its a bit hard to report better, as its not finishing init
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: done
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Kamion	thanks
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Kamion	fabbione: the silo-installer/silo thing is fixed in d-i svn
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: I uploaded pkgstriptranslations.
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: i found my bug.. inittab is all wrong
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: ugh, did you modify it or is it wrong by default?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	tseng	i didnt modify it, not sure how it got this way
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	tseng	will one from hoary do?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: what's wrong with the inittab?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	tseng	its calling /sbin/agetty
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	tseng	and /sbin/rc
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	tseng	which dont even exist
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	tseng	i think someone copied over it
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: I doubt that inittab says agetty by default
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: this would have breaked on each and every installation
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	tseng	yeah someone was f'ing with it
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	tseng	i appologize
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: no worries :-)
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: were you able to restore it?
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: I can send you the default version if necessary
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	tseng	yes, but im totally baffled as to who wouldve copied another distros inittab over this one
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	tseng	heh, i have one here now that i know what is up
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: I'm beginning to think grub and scrubbing disks REALLY don't agree
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: hmm?
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	elmo	I just got that stupid grub failure when reinstalling  a DL380
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	elmo	then again, lilo doesn't work either.  meh.
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Kamion	scrubbing disks?
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	elmo	today sucks.
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	elmo	kamion: when you first create a RAID array and it syncs thems
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Kamion	it would probably be good for me to learn something about RAID, wouldn't it?
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	elmo	yeah, I'm getting exactly the same error as on the Dell's
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	elmo	in that bug-from-hell
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	Kamion	is that the HPT370 one?
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	elmo	nah
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	elmo	one sec
2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	Kamion	locales suck
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	elmo	hmm, I closed the bug.  go me.
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	jdub	it's your birthday.
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	maswan	elmo: did you see my note about bittorrent tracker?
2005-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	elmo	maswan: the port thing?
2005-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	maswan	elmo: yeah
2005-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	elmo	maswan: yeah, thanks
2005-01-01T07:22:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: 2211
2005-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: same failure mode as at the start of that bug?
2005-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	elmo	right
2005-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	elmo	gar, and it's going take eons to scrub half a fricking terabyte
2005-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	Kamion	can you arrange to add the debug command to grub-installer's grub invocation?
2005-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	Kamion	or even run the grub commands by hand in the grub shell
2005-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	elmo	dump (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage1 /tmp/grbdfsbdfsgaz is failing
2005-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	elmo	with "file not found"
2005-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	lamont	anyone need anything before I run?
2005-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	lamont	oh. elmo's here. cool
2005-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: there's some strace's in p.u.c/~james that mdz and I looked at before, there's very little difference between working and broken; I'll try and get some more tho
2005-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	Kamion	grub straces are depressingly uninformative sometimes :(
2005-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	Kamion	as mdz said in the bug, it looks like working-strace was when booted from the hard disk?
2005-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	elmo	right
2005-01-01T07:39:00.000Z	tseng	yay for pax!
2005-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: I'm kind of way out of ideas :-(
2005-01-01T07:40:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: it fends off the buffer overflow exploit as well as SSP
2005-01-01T07:41:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: im very familiar with pax
2005-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: what do you think, is either one (ssp/pax) already enough or should we strive to get both?
2005-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: well, both is ideal
2005-01-01T07:42:00.000Z	tseng	because pax has 0 protection against ret2libc
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	tseng	well, not 0, just adds security-by-obscurity
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: I will put a PaX enabled kernel into universe when I finished the porting to 2.6.9
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	tseng	oh wow
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: no prob - can you remind me the equivalent of grub-installer for lilo tho?  I need at least one bootloader on this thing :)
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: do you happen to know somebody who already did that
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: yes
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: s//?/
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	tseng	the author
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: on the hp there is only a patch for 2.6.7
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	tseng	yes
2005-01-01T07:43:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: lilo-installer
2005-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	fabbione	elmo: lilo-installer?
2005-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	fabbione	argh ;)
2005-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	Kamion	anna should install it by default
2005-01-01T07:44:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: the rejections are not bad, but cause a bit of work
2005-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	elmo	hmm, no lilo in the base system atm
2005-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	elmo	I guess the "Install lilo" step is spassing out real early
2005-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: doesn't need to be, lilo-installer will apt-install it as needed
2005-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	elmo	oh
2005-01-01T07:45:00.000Z	Kamion	if it's used
2005-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	elmo	eh, sorry, to be stupid, but you're saying I should be able to just run 'lilo-installer' from shell?
2005-01-01T07:46:00.000Z	Kamion	no - are you in the d-i environment?
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	elmo	yes
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	Kamion	back up to the main menu and select the menu item to install lilo
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	fabbione	elmo: *cough*sparc*cough* are you having some fun at the dc?
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	elmo	I tried that
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	Kamion	you can try udpkg --configure lilo-installer too
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	elmo	it just says an error occured, and there's nothing helpful on the log tailing screen
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	elmo	what file is that thing tailing?
2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	Kamion	tty3 tails /var/log/messages, tty4 tails /var/log/syslog
2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	jdub	/bin/sh: /usr/bin/apt-listchanges: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	jdub	
2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	elmo	sweeet
2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	Kamion	fixed in new python-defaults

2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: ok, so it's just saying lilo-installer exited with status 1, meh
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: stick 'set -x' at the top of the postinst
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	jdub	Kamion: probably getting that in this upgrade
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	elmo	LOL
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	elmo	it's looking for part156378345346
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	Kamion	welcome to d-i debugging
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	Kamion	wow
2005-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	elmo	(or so)
2005-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	elmo	Kamion: do the final releases have "Unofficial" in the README.diskdefines ?
2005-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	Kamion	can you see what bootfs_devfs and bootfs are being set to?
2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	elmo	this'd be so much easier if we had wireless in here and I could do this without the to-fro
2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	jdub	Errors were encountered while processing:

2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: no
2005-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	Kamion	that'd be linda wanting python ...
2005-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	elmo	ah, okay, maybe I should start from the beginning and burn a fresh CD then
2005-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	Kamion	well, I dunno what'd have been fixed, but I suppose it can't hurt to try ...
2005-01-01T07:53:00.000Z	Kamion	elmo: where's the line with Unofficial?
2005-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	elmo	DISKNAME says "Unofficial binary-i386" in it at the end
2005-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	elmo	fabbione: :(
2005-01-01T07:54:00.000Z	Kamion	#define DISKNAME  Ubuntu 4.10 "Warty Warthog" - Preview i386 Binary-1
2005-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	elmo	this is just a CD which I had lieing around, it could date back to like, June.. 
2005-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	fabbione	elmo: good luck.. 
2005-01-01T07:55:00.000Z	Kamion	I can't even remember when I removed Unofficial; certainly before the preview, but I'm not sure when
2005-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	elmo	ok, trashing and burning fresh from releases.u.c
2005-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: ping?

2005-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	jon1012	hi :)
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Kamion	any suggestions for how to record that /etc/locale.gen has been migrated to UTF-8? if the user later removes the UTF-8 locales, that choice should be respected
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	jon1012	someone when the mono-assemblies-arch and mono-assemblies-base 1.04-1 will be available ?
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	jon1012	(one the hoary repositories)
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	jon1012	beucause impossible to use any mono package until then :/
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	jon1012	(especially monodevelop)
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	tseng	mono apps work for me.
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	jon1012	mmh... when have you updated the packages for the last time ? :/
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	jon1012	try to update or reinstall monodevelop and you will see :(
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	jon1012	everything is broken because these two package are not here
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	jon1012	mmh they are here but in version 1.0.2-1 while mono-jit asks for 1.0.4-1

2005-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: open gthumb, file -> import photos
2005-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: it'll be detected automagically
2005-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	ogra	Simira: doent it getmounted automatically ?
2005-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	ogra	+s

2005-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	Simira	hum
2005-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	Simira	*tries*

2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	ogra	Treenaks: i love my ole olympus
2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: which one? the A85?
2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	ogra: Good Ole'ympus ;)
2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	Simira	no, only an A400. A little bit better than the old one.
2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	ogra	*g*
2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: you've seen mine right? that's a A75
2005-01-01T08:37:00.000Z	ogra	Simira: was yours insured ?
2005-01-01T08:38:00.000Z	Simira	yes, it was
2005-01-01T08:38:00.000Z	ogra	wow, lucky girl;)
2005-01-01T08:39:00.000Z	Simira	well, not the cam, but my travel insurance covered it
2005-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	Treenaks	ogra: mine is ;)
2005-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	Treenaks	I'm doing 100M/day on it 8)
2005-01-01T08:40:00.000Z	ogra	probably there should be a place to upload for all the ppl that can not pay for the traffic.....
2005-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	ogra	Treenaks: looks similar for mine
2005-01-01T08:41:00.000Z	Simira	it won't detect my camera :-/
2005-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	ogra	but there were loads of ppl taking pictures.....
2005-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	Simira	bob2 hasn't put up his, and Tollef. And Mako. Among others
2005-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	Treenaks	bob2 should :)
2005-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	amu	is there a way the xorg config could be done by xorg itself? without a user input, or i've to run the old mkxf86config?
2005-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: I've seen tollef's pics..
2005-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: or at least some of those
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Simira	yep
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	amu: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Simira	hm
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Simira	*grumble*
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	mako	Simira: i won't until i get home
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	ogra	Simira: yep....he has made a really beutiful one of me in the bar
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Simira	:) hehe
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	ogra	+a
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	amu: otherwise: "dexconf"
2005-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	Simira	hm... but I still can't get my camera on Ubuntu... hrmf
2005-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: it's not detected by gthumb?
2005-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	Simira: it should be in "play" mode, otherwise it won't be detected
2005-01-01T08:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	(if it's like mine)
2005-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	amu	Treenaks: it works also if there's no debconf data? need it for the livecd
2005-01-01T08:45:00.000Z	Simira	hm, ok
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Simira	yay
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Simira	it worked
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	ogra	hmm, yesterday i saw daniels saying that the detection stuff is done by xorg itself.....probably he changed something
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Simira	mako: you're still stuck in Spain???
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	mako	Simira: stuck is perhaps not the best term
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	Simira	ah, Daniels also took a lot of picks
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	mako	Simira: i'm in valencia staying with jordi
2005-01-01T08:46:00.000Z	ogra	heh
2005-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	amu	ogra: good question, daniels is away
2005-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	Simira	mako: so, holiday-vacationing, eh?
2005-01-01T08:47:00.000Z	ogra	amu: i heard he is on holiday now....
2005-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: guess what? the whole grsecurity patch applies cleanly against the patched Ubuntu kernel source :-)
2005-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	tseng	pitti: wonderful, i had a feeling it would
2005-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	tseng	im using it in a pretty big patchset myself
2005-01-01T08:50:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: the back of my head always reminded me about long-winded discussions in Debian about the non-applicability to Debian kernels...
2005-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: around and have a minute?
2005-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	pitti	tseng: oops, there are two rejections
2005-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	wasabi_	yay!
2005-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	wasabi_	got my cd's just now
2005-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	wasabi_	wow this are slick
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	fabbione	re
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	fabbione	elmo: ANYTIME!
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	fabbione	elmo: next time don't wait for me... just kick me out :-)
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: yeah
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	elmo	fabbione: don't worry there's no rush, I'm probably only half way through
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	fabbione	elmo: it's 100% your :-)
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	fabbione	i was only doing a test compilation
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	fabbione	nothing really too seriuos... just the ibookg4sleep1337patch
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	fabbione	in the worst case i will tell ppc users to blame GTK
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	elmo	lol
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	ogra	heh
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: PONG!
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: DING DONG DANG!
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: sorry, still at the phone
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	fabbione	Description:
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	fabbione	Remote exploit for IPSwitch WS_FTP version 5.03 that binds a shell to port 4444.
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	fabbione	CUTE!
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	ajmitch_	morning
2005-01-01T10:03:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: back
2005-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	ajmitch_	pitti: thanks for doing those libssp packages :)
2005-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: is there an easy way to provide a hacked kernel image (with new deb names) without duplicating the linux-source source package?
2005-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: yo
2005-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: no problem, easy package
2005-01-01T10:05:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: build-dep on linux-source-2.6.9
2005-01-01T10:05:00.000Z	ajmitch_	pitti: what will be harder is if we try & get selinux in, and enabled by default
2005-01-01T10:05:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: the one that gives you the tar.bz2 in /usr/src
2005-01-01T10:05:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: but i don't recall if it has patches or not.. you will have to check on that
2005-01-01T10:06:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: basically I want to use all the Ubuntu patches, add one, change the configuration and the deb names
2005-01-01T10:06:00.000Z	fabbione	in case... you have linux-patches something
2005-01-01T10:06:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: yup... i got that
2005-01-01T10:06:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: you still need the same build-deps
2005-01-01T10:06:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: okay, I will play around with that
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: basically I would need a binary package that ships the source's dpatches
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	fabbione	no.. you just need to ship your patch
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	fabbione	all the others are in the source or -linux-patch
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	trulux	hi there
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, woo woo!
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	trulux	:)
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	pitti	hi trulux 
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: ah, cool
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	ajmitch_	hi trulux 
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	fabbione	check all the pkgs.. there is everything you need
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	fabbione	the only thing i am not sure we ship are the config
2005-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	fabbione	in that case i will provide them for you.. no big deal for that
2005-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	trulux	hey ajmitch_
2005-01-01T10:09:00.000Z	trulux	ajmitch_, i think we cantry to write a little schedule for the SELinux work
2005-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: I need to change the config anyway; patching yours would be nice, but just copy&change is fine by now
2005-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	ajmitch_	trulux: sure
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: ok.. i will tell you some little secrets about configs tomorrow.. i am watching a movie now ;)
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: oh, then I won't disturb you further
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	pitti	fabbione: enjoy! :-)
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	fabbione	pitti: thanks man
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	fabbione	have a good night
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	pitti	night!

2005-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	trulux	ajmitch_, fine
2005-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	trulux	ajmitch_, why not start a page named SELinux on Debian at the hardened debian wiki
2005-01-01T10:27:00.000Z	trulux	?
2005-01-01T10:28:00.000Z	ajmitch_	go ahead :)
2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	trulux	heh
2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	trulux	let me start a draft
2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: btw, I'm currently at porting the grsecurity patch to the Ubuntu kernel
2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, did you noticed that 2.0.3 is for 2.6.9??
2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	trulux	it's a spender's test patch
2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: yup, that's the one I use
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	trulux	ok
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	ajmitch_	I don't think that grsecurity & selinux will work in the same kernel at all :)
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	ajmitch_	you'd need to choose between them
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: not at the same time
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, don't use it by now
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: but at least I like grsecurity much more than SELinux, so I'm happy :-)
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	trulux	ajmitch_, err, it depends on how the hooks are used and implemented
2005-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	trulux	ajmitch_, we are strange guys here ... don't get sad by this, grsec is much more usable :(
2005-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	trulux	but does a diff thing anyway
2005-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	ajmitch_	iirc grsec may even patch out the LSM hooks from the kernel
2005-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: in theory you _could_ have two chained MAC systems, though :-)
2005-01-01T10:33:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: and grsec does not use LSM
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	ajmitch_	only if you were brave and/or stupid :)
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	ajmitch_	I know that
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	ajmitch_	but I mean that grsec explicitly disables the functionality that selinux uses
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: I don't know whether it would work, and I don't really care
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: actually I mostly care for PaX
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	ajmitch_	it doesn't help that the grsec dev is rather disagreeable ;)
2005-01-01T10:34:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: but since grsecurity applies reasonably well to our kernel, why not take the full patch :-)
2005-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	ajmitch_	selinux is already enabled in upstream debian kernels, packages are in sid
2005-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: the default Ubuntu kernel is also compiled with SELInux (but not enabled)
2005-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: same as in Sid
2005-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	ajmitch_	as long as you're just wanting to have another kernel :)
2005-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: right now this is not intended to replace our default kernel anyway :-)
2005-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: right now it will become an additional kernel in universe, for people wanting PaX
2005-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	ajmitch_	iirc gentoo people had PaX & selinux working together
2005-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: yes, this should be entirely possible
2005-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, i have the selinux hooks for pax
2005-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	trulux	will be inside my backport
2005-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	trulux	which stills is in really panic-state
2005-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	trulux	(that one which means nothing even compiles without brainfucking and so on)
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	wasabi_	So I suspose my next step is going to be building a kerberos 5 .udeb.
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	wasabi_	And d-i piece.
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, btw, what about the gcc patches?
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: will look at them; right now I still have your packages installed
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	trulux	ok, fine
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	gilligan_	hi
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	elmo	can someone do me a favour and try logging into the website?
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	trulux	elmo, hey
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: yes
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	trulux	elmo, did you noticed my enhyancement report to the bugzilla?
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	elmo	trulux: the binutils thing?
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	elmo	pitti: yes, it works or yes, you can try? :)
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: works for me
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	trulux	pitti, we need to have elmo including my PT_PAX_FLAGS stuff inside binutils for having good PaX support
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: now both
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	trulux	(soft mode)
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	elmo	pitti: excellent
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	trulux	elmo, yes
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	elmo	pitti: for your next trick, can you try rosetta?
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: sure
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	gilligan_	have there been any sound related changes to hoary recently ? just did a apt-get upgrade and have a completely sound-free system running now hehe.. ( sorry to bug the dev channel but the general channel is mostly clueless.. )
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: "You are logged in"
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	pitti	elmo: works
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	elmo	pitti: sweet, thanks
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: hmm, right now I use the legacy ELF header marking
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	pitti	trulux: this is way less intrusive
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	gilligan_	i get silence from whatever player i try - no error messages tho.. and nothing seems to be muted according to alsamixer
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	elmo	trulux: sorry, I won't have a chance to look at that till after Christmas - I'm busy in the data centre right now, and on holiday after that
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: is esd still running
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: ?
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: and check in gstreamer-properties that esd is used
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	gilligan_	esd running
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	gilligan_	.. /usr/bin/esd -nobeeps
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: check whether your mixer now has a "DRC" setting which is low
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	gilligan_	pitti: DRC seems to be off
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	gilligan_	and DRC Range = 0
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: can you enable it? This DRC thingy bite me a while ago
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	gilligan_	hum.wonder how ;)
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	trulux	elmo, data center?
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	gilligan_	esd is set to input & output in gstreamer preferences btw
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	elmo	trulux: working on our machines
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	trulux	elmo, we are looking for someone to support us giving a development machine
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	trulux	sponsoring
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	trulux	because we are running on a bit bad-organized network, without a main development center
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	ogra	elmo there are a lot ppl on #ubuntu, ust trying rosetta
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	gilligan_	elmo: ah.. DRC was it..
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: works now?
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	gilligan_	elmo: now i get super-crappy sound but i guess i just have to play around with the mixer a bit
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	gilligan_	elmo: thanks
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	elmo	ogra: when I rebooted it?  sweet :(
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	ogra	hmm... some are a little upset....
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: I had this crappy and silent sound, too; for me it helped to set DRC to about 75%
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	ogra	saving while rebooting.....hm
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	gilligan_	pitti: "DRC" or "DRC Range" ? my "DRC" is still off .. "DRC Range" is set to 75
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	pitti	gilligan_: don't know exactly
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	ironwolf	did apt get borked in hoary?  I keep getting "W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com hoary Release: Unknown error executing gpgv" everytime I do apt-get update.  normal channel doesn't have help to offer.  Any idea where to look for the error text?
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	ajmitch_	trulux: so what will you try & push? grsec or selinux?
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	trulux	grsec as soft option
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	trulux	selinux for the big guys ;D
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	ajmitch_	soft option?
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	pitti	ironwolf: ping mvo tomorrow; he recently introduced signature verification in apt
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	trulux	yes, the easiest to deploy one
2005-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	ajmitch_	do you find selinux hard to deploy?
2005-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	trulux	ajmitch_, not until we get it in the right way
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	trulux	it's a MAC system with TE and so on, it's more difficult to deployt than simple grsec
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	pitti	ajmitch_: one big problem is that selinux requires a bunch of patched base packages, which grsec doesn't
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	ajmitch_	pitti: as long as you don't have to maintain the patches it's ok :)
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	ajmitch_	especially if the patches get merged upstream
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	sid77	hi
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	sid77	hi
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	sivang	hey sid77 
2005-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	sid77	hey, how are you?
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	enrico	hello.  Someone remembers what was in the HowTo wiki page before it messed up?
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	sivang	hmm
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	sivang	how to write howtos? or docs?
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	enrico	someone remembers of an HOWTO index?
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	sivang	I remember..but it vanished right?
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	enrico	right.  Do you remember it had a long list of items?
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	enrico	I just want to make that sure
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	sivang	yes, I do.
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	sivang	it was horroble to navigate, but it was there..
2005-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	enrico	allright
2005-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	enrico	sivang: thanks!
2005-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	sivang	enrico: hey, I didn't do antyhing :)
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	ftwig	hi everybody - updating Wifi Howtos, anyone around who understands WiFi?
2005-01-01T10:18:00.000Z	cenerentola	ftwig: i can try
2005-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	ftwig	ta - http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-07.7773155363/ is what vI am changing.
2005-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	ftwig	I have just added an intor para at the top - have a look
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	cenerentola	ftwig: ok
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	ftwig	Wahts with the stuff about changing the kernel module - it it nessesery - its going to confuse the hell out of newbies.
2005-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	ftwig	good - so my understanding is correct.
2005-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	cenerentola	well the kernel thing is necessary
2005-01-01T10:26:00.000Z	ftwig	so the out of the box one douse not support ndiswrapper
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	Treenaks	/topic anyone?
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	zul	hey seb128 
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	seb128	afternoon
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Treenaks	hi seb
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	sivang	hi sabdfl :)
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	sabdfl	evening sivang
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	Treenaks	hi sabdfl 
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	sabdfl	ready for today's cc meeting?
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	sabdfl	let's give everyone a few minutes to get together
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	mako	whoa
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	sabdfl	hey mako
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: hey
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	Kamion	here
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Kamion	not sure we're getting elmo today
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	mako	done
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	sabdfl	hi kamion, saw those uploads this morning
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	sabdfl	should we get going?
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	sabdfl	smurfix, you around?
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	smurfix	yep
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	mako	and perhaps to ratify it if that's something we need to do
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	sabdfl	the agenda suggests smurfix will intro the country-teams idea
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	sabdfl	smurfix: happy to do so? if so, go ahead
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	smurfix	ok
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	mako	wait one second
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	smurfix	(still typing slowly ;-)
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	sivang	heheh
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	mako	i think it might be better to first introduce the notes from the NM bof
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	sivang	sabdfl: ready as could be.
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: go ahead
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: OK, makes sense
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	mako	because the new distctions between groups have a bearing on the way that this is done
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	sabdfl	righ
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	sabdfl	t
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	mako	https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NewDevelopersAndMaintainers
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mako	those are the super notes written up by plov
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	sabdfl	by way of background to folks who weren't in mataro
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mako	right
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	sabdfl	we had a great session brainstorming on our maintainer process
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	sabdfl	and i think the result is excellent
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mako	those notes they read pretty well as a summary of the conclusion we came to
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	sabdfl	it balances the need to empower people early on, with the need to keep the team technically exceptional
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	mako	but the basic problem we were trying to solve was to find a way to recognize the contributions of people who are not developers or package maintainers
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	mako	and to enfranchise them within the governnance system
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	sabdfl	and recognises that there are lots of ways people participate, and gives those people a voice
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	mako	the document will do a better job than what t i can type now
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	mako	but the basic idea is that we have members who are recognized by this body
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	mako	and they will be able to confirm new members of the CC
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	mako	and they should have contributed meaningful to the community
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	mako	but they do not need to be package maintainers
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	mako	the rest of the system is basically the same as before
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Kamion	procedurally, as I understand it, this means we approve members and then pass them to the TB for technical approval if they want to go one step further up; this reads as a codification of what we've been informally doing up to now
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	mako	except that maintainer is now a purely technical distinction
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: i'd prefer to think of it as a lateral step, but yes :)
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	Kamion	either way :)
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	sabdfl	also clarifies the distinction between committer and maintainer
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: it was unclear what to do with non-technical applicants in the past
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	mako	right
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	sabdfl	and allows for commit rights to be given on specific components or packages
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	mako	as a result, we have a couple people on the agenda for today who are applying for member status in the community but who are not currently pursuing TB approval to upload
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: i think we should write this up as a formal doc and have it approved by the cc
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	mako	and these are connected to thehe country teams as well
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: and then move it into the website governance page/pages
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	mako	yeah, that sounds ideal.. i think that doc provides most of what we need
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	sabdfl	we can get going right away with new members, on the basis that the cc were all there
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: i'll have that ready for the next CC meeting
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: great, thanks!
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	sabdfl	any initial comments from folks who were not at the mataro sessions?
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	mako	it's also worth mentioning that there was some good work done on mentoring processes by Chris Haas
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	mako	who is going to be helping out with a mentoring system for ubuntu.. really great work
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	sabdfl	yes
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	sabdfl	folks who are keen to become committers or maintainers would benefit greatly from spending some time with ChrisH
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	sabdfl	also, we agreed to review very quickly any proposed packages from new maintainer candidates
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	ChrisH	You are all invited for a pizza. ;)
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Kamion	I'm particularly glad to see that because it will mean that much of the mentoring process doesn't have to start with Canonical staff who are already heavily committed in many cases
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	sabdfl	but the actual detailed back and forth to get a package up to scratch if it isn't right first time is best handled by the mentoring process
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	Treenaks	ChrisH: where? :)
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	Kamion	proposed packages> was it within two days or so?
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	sabdfl	two working, i think
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako, could you document the process on that front as well too please?
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	Kamion	I think we should agree to at least get back to them with feedback within that time; there'll be cases of very large packages which take a long time to review
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	sabdfl	we'll need some sort of workflow to track that commitment
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	Kamion	the key is to not leave people stalled during the review process
2005-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: yes, of course
2005-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	sabdfl	agreed
2005-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	sabdfl	any other comments on the new maintainer process?
2005-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	mako	not right now
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	mako	i'll send the draft to -devel
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	sivang	we just need some good, accessible docs for it I guess
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	mako	so we can take discussion onto the lists
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	sabdfl	good idea
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	mako	let move on
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: you're up
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	sabdfl	do we have any members up for approval?
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: only connected to doc team work
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	sivang	and country teams :)
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: ^^^
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	mako	i meant country teams
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	sabdfl	right
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	smurfix	So, back to country teams, as those who are on the CC agenda today want to become team leaders ;-)
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	mako	two thinkos
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	smurfix: yes
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	Kamion	looks like Treenaks and sivang are both up for membership approval?
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	smurfix	Many of the country teams basically organized themselves -- we want to take advantage of that, recognize their contributions, and make that a more integrated part of Ubuntu
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: right
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	smurfix	The technical side of "what we want from the country team" is on the CountryTeams wiki page
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Kamion	the NM bof notes equate Ubuntite with activist, so that may not be the best term for use on the agenda
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: i changed it
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	smurfix	basically, IRC and mailing list and maybe a forum and whatnot
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	mako	reload
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	Kamion	mako: aha, thanks
2005-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	sabdfl	can we agree on Ubuntite?
2005-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	sabdfl	oh, there's a zillion typos waiting to happen there...
2005-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	Kamion	I think my main concern for country teams is that there should be somebody responsible for liaising with the primarily English-speaking development community as necessary
2005-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: nothing we aren't used to :)
2005-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	Kamion	we can follow ubuntu-users (mostly ...), but generally not ubuntu-nl etc.
2005-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	smurfix	also it might make sense for Ubuntu to have a common second-level domain names if at all possible
2005-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: oh, good idea!
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	sabdfl	we could do nl.ubuntulinux.org etc very easily
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: we can have them send summaries to be included in traffic!
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	Kamion	that would be good
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	sabdfl	but i think it's more effective to have domains that match standard practice in that country
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: in what way? for "localization needs"?
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	sivang	why not having localized ubuntu domains?
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: great idea
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	mako	that would be *great*
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	smurfix	which the team leaders can help orgainze, though happily I co-own an ISP which does international domain registrations *grin*
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	sivang	sabdfl: I have already started doing that :) as of my conversation with lu from last week.
2005-01-01T05:21:00.000Z	Kamion	Treenaks: users frequently report bugs on the users mailing list
2005-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	smurfix	you all type way too fast for me ;-)
2005-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: oh stuff like that.. yeah forwarding/translating those would be an idea :)
2005-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	smurfix	we might want to make that Wiki list-of-stuff a more integral part of the site later; for now I've started the CountryTeamList page ten minutes ago
2005-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	sabdfl	also, to help coordinate the migration of code into the main distro, like input methods and font decisions etc
2005-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: that too, yes
2005-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	sivang	sabdfl: the thing is, we need to see what std. form those localized sites can take, if to follow the main layout of ulinux.org etc, or have their own layout at the moment.
2005-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	Kamion	and to act as points of contact on geopolitical issues
2005-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	Kamion	although sometimes external observers may be less biased; it depends
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	sabdfl	i think we want to be as empowering as possible
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	mako	there are tons of things that the team can do
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	sabdfl	which means offer people the use fo the official artwork and css if they want, but also let them to anything else if they think it suits their community better
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	Kamion	agreed
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	mako	but if it's only to provide an interface between existing ubuntu community and the rest of the project, it's owrthwhile
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	sabdfl	Kamion: hot button :-)
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	smurfix	My list of the social part of the country team leader's responsibility so far:
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	mako	i think we can think pretty big.. each team will be different
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	smurfix	- be visible in the local community, of course ;-)
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	Kamion	sabdfl: indeed - an important one for many countries though
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	smurfix	- keep a list of regional contacts
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	smurfix	- remind people of / enforce the CoC if necessary
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: CoC = ?
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	Kamion	code of conduct
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	Treenaks	Code of Conduct
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	sivang	eh
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	sivang	:0
2005-01-01T05:25:00.000Z	sivang	:)
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	sabdfl	i'd like the country teams to have a high visibility on our home page
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	sabdfl	we thought of flags, but that can be too divisive
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl:  a map?
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	sabdfl	and we may have to refer to the teams as "regional teams" rather than country teams
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	sivang	sabdfl: maybe a special section for the country team, like "Ubuntu in your country,lang etc"
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	smurfix	the other stuff on my llist has already been mentioned while I was busy typing ;-)
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	sivang	*teams
2005-01-01T05:26:00.000Z	Kamion	flags *definitely* best avoided
2005-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	Kamion	likewise maps indicating country borders; you can go to jail in some countries for that (!)
2005-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	sabdfl: yes, I notice lots of Flemish people (who also speak Dutch) come to the Dutch support
2005-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	sabdfl: so it's more a language thing than a country thing for me
2005-01-01T05:27:00.000Z	sabdfl	lithping ever thinth?
2005-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	smurfix	Treenaks: the distinction between these two isna't always readily apparent
2005-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	smurfix	isn't
2005-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	Treenaks	smurfix: true..
2005-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	mako	i think we can push this convesation to the lists or put it on hold until afterwards
2005-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	mako	i think mark's suggestion to have good visible on the website is a good idea
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	mako	we just need to iron out how to do it correctly
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	sabdfl	ok, but let's at least publically thank the guys who have stepped up so far
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	smurfix	anyway, that's it from me, for now.
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	sabdfl	and invite them to have a say in ubuntu as members
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	mako	we can do that
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	mako	it's even on the agenda :)
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	sabdfl	is niels around?
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	Treenaks	who is he on irc?
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	mako	i don't know his nick
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	mako	does anyone know Niels Kjller Hansen's nick?
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	sabdfl	nope
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	sabdfl	he doesn't have a wiki page
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	mako	then we can defer that decision unitl the next kmeeting
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	mako	i think both sivang and Treenaks should be uncontroversial :)
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	Treenaks	Whee :)
2005-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	sabdfl	kamion?
2005-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	sivang	yey! :)
2005-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	mako	sivang and Treenaks were both at the conference and did good work there and both have been active in trying to help define what a country team is through planning and example
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	Kamion	sabdfl: I don't, sorry
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	sabdfl	Kamion: que?
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	Kamion	neils' nick
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	sabdfl	ah
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	Kamion	niels, sorry
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sivang	hehe
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	mako	can we confirm them?
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sabdfl	i was just checking if you were also happy with treenaks and sivang
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	mako	or are thehere more questions?
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	Kamion	oh, yes, I met them both and I'm fine with both
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sabdfl	i'm thrilled with both of their contributions too
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sabdfl	welcome aboard, both of you
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	thanks
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sivang	sabdfl: thank you!
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sivang	thanks all
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang, Treenaks: could you update the draft list at CountryTeamList? (Though not at the same time please ;-)
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: sure thing
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	mako	Treenaks, sivang: you have the privledge/difficulty of defining the rules of this as you go :)
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	mako: cool :)
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	sivang	:)
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	mako	you should stay in touch withs smurfix and myself who can bring your experience into best practices for groups that come after you :)
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	sabdfl	smurfix: would you like to play a more general role in the country teams?
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	sabdfl	did you take this one on?
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: dure
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: he did at the marketing meeting
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	smurfix	sure
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	sabdfl	ok, let's document that on the wiki and site
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: i mean, i don't want to speak for you :)
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	sabdfl	yes, i recall, was just looking for the bof notes :-)
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	sabdfl	this is a very exciting step
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: I'll update the pages as appropriate over the next couple days
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	sabdfl	we set a high goal: 50 countries for Hoary, right?
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: i think this warrants a mail to -devel and -users as well
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: right.
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: at least
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	sabdfl	i'd rather concentrate things there than -announce for the moment
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: lets work together to get announcment out by the end of thehe week
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	sabdfl	because we want it to reach people who are active
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	smurfix: updated
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	mako	ther eis also -news
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	mako	i think we've fallen off the end of the agenda
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: Can you write a first draft?
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	sabdfl	let's stick to -devel and -users for the moment
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: sure..
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	mako	speaking of...
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	mako	TB meeitng next week?
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: ping me when you're done editing the list page ?
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: postponed?
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: k
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: yes, i think so, can check with mdz later
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: alright.. we shoudl make an announcment
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: if it is postponed
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	sabdfl	ok, and update the wiki page
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	sabdfl	i'll update the wiki agenda pages now
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	sabdfl	any other business?
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	mako	that's all i have now
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	Kamion	nothing from me
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	sivang	sec
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	mako	jan 4 same time
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	sabdfl	sivang had a last question, worth mentioning here
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	mako	?
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	mako	go ahead
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	sivang	What about localized websites? What if a country team cannot provide the hosting himself? will canonical be in help of that?
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	sabdfl	what sorts of things could help?
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	Kamion	do we have sufficient plone suport for that?
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	Kamion	"support"
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	sabdfl	not easily
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	sabdfl	plone is sort of all or nothing
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	stuff like automatic browser language detection?
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	sabdfl	hmm... yes i tihnk it does that
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	mako	there are two ways of handlin this
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	sabdfl	so we can have pages in the main site that are translated, and served correctly
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	ChrisH	I remember someone in Mataro said it would be possible to provide the same pages (of www.ubuntulinux.org) in different languages.
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	Kamion	was thinking more of being able to store the localised version of a page with the English one
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	mako	jane and lulu and i talked at the conference about getting someone to handle website improvements and such
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	mako	this sort of thing would be on the top of the list
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	Kamion	rather than just kludging _nl onto the end of every page :)
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	sivang	I was speaking, could we get webspace over a cnonical server? :) or firms which we can interest in supporting ubuntu in that way?
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: that'd suck :)
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	smurfix	I can setup something on my hosted machine for people who need a place for hosting
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	sabdfl	we could also sponsor a web server for those country teams that need one, with virtual hosts for them
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	mako	currently, folks just have translated pages in wikis and on their ownm servers
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: the tacking-on-_nl thing
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	sivang	sabdfl: my thought exactly :)
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: might be nice
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Kamion	Treenaks: indeed
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	sabdfl	it would have limited shell support i imagine, but be good enough for website hosting
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	ChrisH	Let's keep the localised versions on the same server. No use to have a seperat server on the internet for each lang.
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	mako	sabdfl: but almost all i've seen had php
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Kamion	mako: problem with that is that they get out of date trivially
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Kamion	translation tracking is just as important as a one-shot effort
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	mako	which doesn't go over well with thom :)
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	mako	Kamion: yes, of course
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	sabdfl	i tihnk some critical docs need to be translated on the main server
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	sabdfl	like CoC
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	mako	i think a plone based solution makes  sthe most sense
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	sivang	we should see if we can have rosetta support web site translations :)
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	sabdfl	and governance docs, nm docs etc
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	Treenaks	Kamion: changes-mail, like the wiki does when you "subscribe" to a page?
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	sabdfl	but much of the local community stuff can best be hosted on a country-team website
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	sabdfl	like, when people are meeting up, and where
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: exactly
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	smurfix	if people need space for that they can talk to me
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	smurfix	since they're going to talk to me anyway ;-)
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	sabdfl	smurfix: that's very kind of you
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: don't worry, you'll get a bill for it ;-)  ;-)
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	Treenaks	oh, we're having a -nl dinner/keysigning some time in January -- if anyone's near Utrecht then, they're welcome to join
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	sivang	we'll start with that and see how this scales?
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	mako	smurfix: alright.. perhaps we can trust some sort of short terms solution to the planning for the counry teams
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	sabdfl	if it turns into a lot of work we can rent space on a commercial basis somewhere for the teams
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: do you have plone already installed? or moin moin? :)
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	smurfix	sabdfl: I don't expect it will -- I'l speak up if it's going to be a problem.
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	sabdfl	ok guys, let's wrap up
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	mako	sivang: good point though.. we definitely know it's a problem
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: moin, yes. Plone not yet
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mako	alright
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mako	Jan 4, 1600?
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mako	UTC?
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	smurfix	sivang: I expect the stuff that needs plone to be located on the main site anyway
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	sabdfl	mako: tb?
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mako	that would be the currently scheduled CC meeting if we wait two weeks
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mako	if we just want to pretend like next week doesn't happen
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	sivang	smurfix: ah ok, I just wanted to .il one to have consistent look with the main one.
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	mako	the next meeting would be in three weeks  son the 11th
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	smurfix	mako: that makes sense
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	mako	i tend to think that 2 weeks is a good interval but since one week will be holidays for many people, the 11th would work
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	sabdfl	ok, tb on jan 4th
2005-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	sabdfl	thanks everybody
2005-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	mako	see you next year :)

2005-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	sivang	mako: exactly !
2005-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	jordi	estic cercant els meus pantalons!
2005-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	jordi	dudes, you gotta pick the Catalan trends.
2005-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	jordi	hmm. wtf.
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	Blackwell	Quest-Master: no linux distro beats debian as far as upgradability/updatability is concerned, as i keep hearing.
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Or Ubuntu.
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	ogra	Blackwell: ubuntu is debian......
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	Pozac	Finkel is Einhorn
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	ogra	really 8)
2005-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	Blackwell	ogra: so it would seem. but the same may apply to knoppix. however...the #debian folks seem to think that knoppix is not debian. i am afraid that ubuntu may spark the same level of not-welcomness.
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Yeah.
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Quest-Master	#debian hates Knoppix to death.
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Quest-Master	I don't know about Ubuntu though.
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Blackwell	Quest-Master: ;) i guess ubuntu may not have appeared on their radar yet.
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Quest-Master	But a lot of the Ubuntu developers are Debian developers as well.
2005-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Pozac	how can you hate ubuntu?
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	sjoerd	Quest-Master: a channels doesn't hate anything, maybe some people on the channel do
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	Blackwell	so, there aren't any major stray-aways in ubuntu in comparison to debian, are there? nothing that would make debian folks groan and roll their eyes at?
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Not really.
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	noob	hey guys, since there are more people on #debian, do you think i could ask if anyone has already re-create a boot record from the ubuntu install cd?
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	Blackwell	Quest-Master: excellent news, thank you.
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	ogra	Blackwell: the company behind ubuntu has some of the most imoportant debian devs employed....they make sure all changes go back to debian
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	Blackwell	noob: try. report the reaction please. ;)
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	Quest-Master	:)
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	noob	i shouldnt do that ? :)
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	mdke	noob, you can do it
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	Pozac	noob, yeah, the process is basically the same.. :)
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	ogra: ah, that sounds very good. :)
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	mdke	you can do whatever you like
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	noob	sorry , i dont know thats why i ask you first
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	noob	:P
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	mdke	this is a free network
2005-01-01T12:03:00.000Z	ogra	Blackwell: ubuntu is synced quite often with sid before the release freeze
2005-01-01T12:04:00.000Z	ogra	Blackwell: so in ubuntu unstable you get mostly debian sid with ubuntu-ongonig-changes
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	dagron	wtf? I can't get su.. su (enter) password: (password) and it won't work. this is far different from slackware.
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	dagron	:)
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	sudo su
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	azta	dagron: ubuntu has copied off OSX
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	root is disabled by default
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	Pitr	did you sign up for the slackware-rehab exam?
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	dagron	sudo su (enter) password ?
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	ogra	dagron: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	yes dagraon
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	dagron	great
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	azta	dagron: root has no password, so you can't login as root...
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	dagron*
2005-01-01T12:06:00.000Z	Pozac	unless you use webmin?
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	Pozac	or has that been fixed? :)
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	azta	dagron: after that you can "passwd" btw
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	you just sudo su for root access , if you want a root account, type sudo passwd root and then enter a new password
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	dagron	dunno. just installed ubuntu last hour or so.
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	Pozac	sudo -s also works for a root shell
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	Marble2	hey
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	dagron	nice
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	I'm trying to get some sort of nvidia hardware exceleration for my ubuntu imac
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	Marble2	I have beep-media-player installed, how do I run it so taht I don't have to keep the terminal window open
2005-01-01T12:07:00.000Z	Marble2	for it to stay running
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Pozac	add a &
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	azta	beep & disown
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Pozac	or run it from the menu :)
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Marble2	space or no?
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Pozac	space
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	azta	Marble2: doesn't matter
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Marble2	doesnt work
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Marble2	still dies when I close the window
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Marble2	can I use screen?
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	azta	beep&disown == beep    &    disown
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Marble2	i'm a screen newbie
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	azta	Marble2: & disown
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	dagron	thanks dudes. now I have root :)
2005-01-01T12:08:00.000Z	Marble2	kk
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	np dagron ^+^
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	ogra	dagron: you wont gain anything with it
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	azta	otherwise the shell just backgrounds it, and will kill it when it dies
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	Marble2	thanks azta
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	Marble2	worked
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	dagron	is everything different in ubuntu ?
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	azta	np
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	Pozac	no
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	azta	dagron: no
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	dagron	thought it would be kind of like slack
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	ogra	dagron: all gui tools require gksudo
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	not everything, it's still linux
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	thenuke	ogra: like you could do anything what you want without root?
2005-01-01T12:09:00.000Z	Pozac	dagron, it's very much debian :)
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	dagron	never used debian :S
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	ogra	thenuke: that as well ;)
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	dagron	im a slack fanatic
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	dagron	;)
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	Pozac	dagron, this is the nicest debian experience I have ever tried :)
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	dagron	yes ubuntu is nice.
2005-01-01T12:10:00.000Z	dagron	though it feels like the first time I sit in front of a pewter :S
2005-01-01T12:11:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	anyone running ubuntu on ppc ?
2005-01-01T12:11:00.000Z	ogra	tha_gamemaster: lots of ppl do......
2005-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	azta	tha_gamemaster: on a g3 ibook here
2005-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	ogra,  is anyone of those people available for me to ask them a question ^_^
2005-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	azta nvidia or ati card in your ibook?
2005-01-01T12:12:00.000Z	azta	tha_gamemaster: if it's regarding broken resume on wake no :)
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	azta	tha_gamemaster: ATI rage mobility thing
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	azta hehe no I'm using it on an iMac, I experienced that error already on my ibook G3, I'm trying to enable hardware video acceleration.
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	dagron	Ubuntu can use Debian packages?
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	azta	tha_gamemaster: ah, good luck :)
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	ogra	tha_gamemaster: runs fine on my imac at the office
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	dagron yea
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	Pozac	I would love for dpkg/apt to be replaced in synaptic by a more library-ish interface
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	Blackwell	dagron: it is debian, just in a more friendly way, it seems.
2005-01-01T12:13:00.000Z	jdub	dagron: preferably not; they're almost entirely available from universe/multiverse anyway
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	ogra	dagron: you shouldnt
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	azta	tha_gamemaster: this only has 8mb videoram, which wasn't enough for the dri stuff
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	dagron	aah. just like Vidalinux ?
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	EfaistOs	some users of webcam here ?
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	Pozac	there's no dselect.. woohooo
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	azta	tha_gamemaster: I haven't tried it in about 18 months though...
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	ogra	dagron: and ubuntu has 99% of the debian packages already in
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	ogra I have X, but you can tell from my opengl screen savers that there is no hardware exceleration...
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	jdub	dagron: (ubuntu is completely rebuilt, so there's no guarantee that actual debian packages will work)
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	ungood	could someone help me with getting my RAID 0 array working?
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	Marble2	what the fuck is wrong with beep-media-player
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	Marble2	its a POS
2005-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	mplayer is good
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Pozac	Marble2, yes. Sadly
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	dagron	argh. but I want my aterm and irssi.. going to try at least
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	azta	ungood: just mount it?

2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	just get mplayer or videolan client
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Marble2	prozac, what should I use?
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	ogra thank you ^_^
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Blackwell	dagron: ubuntu seems strictly non commercial too, debian spirited in a way, i guess.
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Marble2	i want to play mp3s
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Pozac	Marble2, xmms or rhythmbox
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	azta	ungood: what raid card ?
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	marble2, xmms
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	jdub	Blackwell: it's highly commercial (it's just Free, too)
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Marble2	can I apt-get it?
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	ungood	Promise Fasttrak 100
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Pozac	yep
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	Marble2	cool
2005-01-01T12:15:00.000Z	azta	ungood: is it a true hardware raid card?
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Blackwell	jdub: that burb on their page seemed to give a different impression. ;)
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	ogra	Marble2: rhythmbox is already there
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	ungood	azta: I don't think so
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	vegai	how does ubuntu work with non-alsa sound drivers?
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Marble2	it is shitty, i tried it
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	azta	ungood: um :(
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	vegai	OSS supported ok?
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Pozac	xmms is the good old player
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	jdub	Marble2: dude, keep it nice please
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	azta	xmms is the sucky old player
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Marble2	sorry
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Marble2	in uh rythmbox
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Marble2	it won't show my files
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	Marble2	it import
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	ungood	Ubuntu sees the two drives, but it doesn't want to combine them into one, it seems.
2005-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	jdub	did you install gstreamer0.8-mad?
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	ungood	I don't want to format them, because I would lose a ton of my music.
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	azta	ungood: ah, you want the linux raid howto I guess
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	macewan	muine may be of use
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	ogra	Marble2: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	seeya azta
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	ungood	ok, I'll look into that. Thanks :)
2005-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	Pozac	Muine is sweet.
2005-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	macewan	it does have that cool factor
2005-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	brb
2005-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	vegai	no-one?
2005-01-01T12:18:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: what for oss ?
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: everything is replaced by alsa, oss will die anyway
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	rwabel	hi
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	Pozac	hello
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	vegai	I have a soundcard that's properly supported by only the 4Front driver. I was wondering whether oss is supported here
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	rwabel	i've a big problem with gnome 2.9.2 on ubuntu hoary
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	macewan	what sound card?
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: there surely is an alsa driver that works
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	vegai	I sure hope that ALSA will become a bit better before it kills OSS
2005-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, yes?
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	vegai	ogra: negative.
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	rwabel	the whole panel is away and the desktop is unusable
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: what card ?
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	macewan	brb
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: I don't know if it's a bug or sth like that. or if I did sth to the config
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	vegai	M-Audio Revolution 7.1, an ice1724-chip based card. And don't pretend to know more about this than me, please :)
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	Marble2	yay
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	back
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	Marble2	xmms kicks ass
2005-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, no, I think you just upgraded.. I had that problem too, not sure how I fixed it
2005-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-3-686/kernel/sound/pci/ice1712/snd-ice1724.ko
2005-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: sudo apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade didn't help
2005-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	vegai	ogra: did I ask you not to pretend you know more about this than I?
2005-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	Marble2	ok, now what can I use to play video files
2005-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	macewan	ouch
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, I managed to get it running by trying a few times and killing leftover processes in between
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	Marble2	is mpc linux compatabile?
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: there is a alsa module .... dont you think it works ?
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	Pozac	good ol' ctrl-alt-backspace, slay pozac routine
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	vegai	yes, I've tried that module
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	vegai	it has problems
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	ogra	vegai: with the right options ?
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	Pozac	slay is the coolest tool
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	Quest-Master	What's with the attitude vegai? ogra's just trying to help.
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	vegai	yes
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	macewan	I'm in the middle of that myself.
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	Pozac	Marble2, I recommend totem-xine
2005-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: I tried to kill some gnome panels etc and I got only the taskbar from the bottom back. the rest like the desktop and the top panel still away
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, do you use GDM? try startx
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	vegai	Quest-Master: how?
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Marble2: totem-xine was pretty unstable for me. Use gxine.. simple, fast :)
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	macewan	killall gnome-panel
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: yes gdm. tried startx, reboot, restart gdm
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	vegai	yes, ok, sorry. I guess you get a lot of clueless people here sometimes.
2005-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	ogra	Quest-Master: thank you, i can cope with that ..... in fact he warned me ;)
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	rwabel	macewan: ahh that one I didn't know yet. I've to go back to gnome window manager, I'm in xfce at the moment
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	stuNNed_	is ubuntu slow on anyone else's laptop? odd.
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, I don't think I know then, sorry.. :(
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_: you don't happen to have a toshiba, do you?
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	Quest-Master	lol
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	vegai	but back to the question... I guess everything's linked against OSS libraries too?
2005-01-01T12:24:00.000Z	macewan	brb
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	vegai	I shouldn't be worried, though. The 4Front driver has an ALSA emulating layer
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: I'll try the killall gnome-panel
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	vegai	like ALSA has an OSS emulating layer ;)
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	|QuaD-	hey, anyone here have any experience with webhosts and python scripts?
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	vegai	kinda ironic...
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	jdub	vegai: warty is set up to use alsa drivers, but via the oss emulation modules (not using alsalibs)
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	vegai	hmm, it will tough then :/
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, do that
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	vegai	jdub: it's mostly autodetected, right?
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	jdub	no
2005-01-01T12:25:00.000Z	DigiKill	evenin
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	vegai	ok, that's better
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	jdub	if you want to use oss stuff, it will just work
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	vegai	jdub: no, but I don't want ALSA.
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub, no dell inspiron 1.8ghz cpu/512ram/gf2go and it's pretty slow for some reason, refreshing windows and the like
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	Pozac	unless you alsa driver's oss layer thingie sucks :(
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	vegai	oh, right. Sorry again :)
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: seems that the probem is only related to my specific user. loging in with another user works fine
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	vegai	good
2005-01-01T12:26:00.000Z	DigiKill	Question: anyone compiled an Eggdrop bot on Ubuntu yet?
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	toxickore	hello people....
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	jdub	Pozac: the in-kernel oss emulation stuff is better than using alsalibs atm
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, yeah - perhaps something in ~/.gconf ?
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	jdub	Pozac: that's why we chose to use it
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	toxickore	how can i know if i'm using the latest ubuntu distro version?
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	jd85	i'm attempting to do an install of ubuntu on my laptop, and before with other distros i'd have to do ide=nodma at boot, but i dont know what `kernel` put in there and such, so i dont know what to do because it wont detect cd
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	ogra	toxickore: there is only one currently
2005-01-01T12:27:00.000Z	Pozac	jdub, ok :)
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	jdub	toxickore: cat /etc/lsb-release, if it says 'warty' and 4.10, you're using the latest release.
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	toxickore	jd85: let's see
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	toxickore	jd85: yup... it's the 4.10
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	toxickore	jd85: thank you dude..
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	jd85	toxickore: may i add i'm a gentoo user and just need somthing that wont hog all of my cpu on my laptop lol its a 266, do you think it will run alright? its a p2
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	jd85	oops
2005-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	jd85	not to toxickorebut to everyone
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	toxickore	ooops...
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	jd85	yea two oops
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	jdub	jd85: RAM matters, not CPU
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	toxickore	jdub: my answer was to you
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	toxickore	jd85: =P
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	jd85	jdub: i have 128mb... that enough
2005-01-01T12:29:00.000Z	jd85	jdub: if i can even get it to 'find the cd'
2005-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: no luck. it only gave me back the bottom panel. ther other one where the gnome stuff is (like system etc) is still away
2005-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	jdub	i'd recommend 256MB at the least for using gnome on ubuntu
2005-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	jdub	(gnome plus anything useful on top)
2005-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, and you can't click on anything, right?
2005-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	jd85	jdub: well thats the max the laptop can take, have any suggestions? its only got a 3.1 gig hard drive..
2005-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	jdub	rwabel: killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus trashapplet gnome-panel
2005-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	ogra	jd85: you could try xfce4 as a replacement with smaller footprint
2005-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: right
2005-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	jd85	ogra: but not with ubuntu?
2005-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	ogra	jd85: should work with 128 but you wont benefit form all the nice gnome integration
2005-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	rwabel	jdub: thanks, gonna try that one out
2005-01-01T12:32:00.000Z	ogra	jd85: sure with ubuntu....
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	Pozac	I would like to once again point out that 'slay' is a wonderful tool no keen ubuntu user should be without.
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	Marble2	gar
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	noob	sorry, but what is slay for? :)
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	Marble2	i can't get audio working on VLC
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	zenwhen	I am running a caching server with 64MB of ram with Ubuntu. It is CERTAINLY not useable as a desktop with that little ram though.
2005-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	Marble2	any ideas?
2005-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	Pozac	noob, it kills all processes belonging to a user :)
2005-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	noob	ok
2005-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	noob	:)
2005-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	Pozac	like the name sort of implies :)
2005-01-01T12:34:00.000Z	rwabel	jdub: yeah great nautilus and trahsapplet did the job. thank you very much
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	zenwhen	I think 128 Might be ok, but I am getting a 256MB stick for it and a small monitor so I can use synergy to add it to my desktop.
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	zenwhen	:)
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	Marble2	anyone?
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	Pozac	Marble2, hold on, lemme install it...
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	zenwhen	Marble2, you get sound in everything else?
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub, any idea why it might be slow?
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	Marble2	yea
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub, this is ubuntu unstable, current.
2005-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	Marble2	xmms and such gets sound
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	Marble2	brb bathroom
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	ogra	stuNNed_: with xcompmanager ?
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	rwabel	jdub: but after a logout and login again the same problem
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	zenwhen	have you tried multiple files Marble2
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	zenwhen	?
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	stuNNed_	ogra, not sure if i'm using that or not, haven't manually enabled it.
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	jdub	rwabel: do it again, and save your session as you log out
2005-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_: no strong ideas, no
2005-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	ogra	stuNNed_: it draws shadows around your windows and you have to enable it .....
2005-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	stuNNed_	ogra, then no
2005-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	rwabel	judb: thanks
2005-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	stuNNed_	jdub, could be 'nvidia' drivers or whatever agp i'm using you think?
2005-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	stuNNed_	ogra, thanks
2005-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	jdub	stuNNed_: dunno
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	Marble2	yes zenwhen
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	ogra	stuNNed_: nvidia drivers form where ? are there any for xorg already ?
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	Marble2	i have
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	stuNNed_	ogra, yes
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	stuNNed_	ogra, using what's in ubuntu unstable
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	stuNNed_	ogra, which is not latest afaik
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	zenwhen	Do OTHER video apps exhibit this issue?
2005-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	Pozac	Marble2, hmm.. do you have the sound server enabled?
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	Pozac	I again recommend totem-xine.
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	Marble2	i'll try totem-xine
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	zenwhen	Check Settings -> preferences and make sure "Use spdif when available" isnt checked as well.
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	Pozac	xmms is like winamp in the old days, and totem-xine is like a good edition of the classic windows media player :)
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	zenwhen	under Audio.
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	zenwhen	Gxine is good as well.
2005-01-01T12:39:00.000Z	Pozac	BEFORE everyone had to live off writing media players :(
2005-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	Marble2	i just unchecked it zenwhen
2005-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	Marble2	still no audio
2005-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	zenwhen	damn
2005-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	Pozac	try running vlc from a terminal and see if it shows errors
2005-01-01T12:40:00.000Z	Pozac	like /dev/dsp in use or whatnot
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	Marble2	the hell
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	Marble2	a vlc restart fixed it
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	Marble2	works like a charm now
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	Pozac	It might be the sound server :)
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	zenwhen	It ws the spdif thing i bet.
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	vlc is good
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	Marble2	probably
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	zenwhen	KMIX does the same thing if you install KDE but it takes away ALL sound.
2005-01-01T12:42:00.000Z	zenwhen	lol
2005-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	Pozac	I've had some sync issues with it in the past
2005-01-01T12:43:00.000Z	rwabel	judb: by default it saves the session. is there a way to tell gnome to do it explicit?
2005-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	Pozac	gnome-session-save perhaps?
2005-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	jdub	rwabel: it doesn't save the session by default. click log out, look at the option at the bottom of the logout box.
2005-01-01T12:45:00.000Z	jblack	Hmmm. Either at or atq is broken
2005-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	rwabel	jdub: there are no option only logout, reboot and shutdown
2005-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	jblack	looks like at
2005-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	Pozac	My at says Garbled time
2005-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	Pozac	hehe
2005-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	jdub	rwabel: 'save current setup' at the top
2005-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	euphoria	hi all
2005-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	zenwhen	hey
2005-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, you can run 'gnome-session-save'
2005-01-01T12:47:00.000Z	rwabel	jdub: strange. are you sure.... and then the 3 options
2005-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: thanks gonna try that
2005-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	how can I test what type of framebuffer I'm running ?
2005-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	like what driver it's using from the kernel.
2005-01-01T12:48:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel, I also have that option
2005-01-01T12:49:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	brb
2005-01-01T12:50:00.000Z	rwabel	pozac: yes, it worked. thanks...must have a different logout version. or maybe it's a setting question in gnome
2005-01-01T12:50:00.000Z	rwabel	thanks for the help
2005-01-01T12:50:00.000Z	Pozac	np

2005-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	mdke	what were they talking about?
2005-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	Blackwell	"ram is like sex, ..."

My screen is slightly off center and it's annoying.  There are things on the right side I can't read or access.
2005-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	Blackwell, ain't it the truth ^_^
2005-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	ogra	mdke: all the special ubuntu stuff.... some basics on packaging and the exciting launchpad stuff
2005-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	oh well, kernel compilation time.
2005-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	Blackwell	urgs, my sympathies.
2005-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	ogra	mdke: indeed there was a lot more, but thats what i picked.....
2005-01-01T01:08:00.000Z	mdke	ogra, what is that xss thing?

2005-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	sjoerd	oh, the kicking cops picture :)
2005-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	Blackwell	tha_gamemaster: you'll do fine i bet.
2005-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	Blackwell	you don't sound like a kernel recompilation allergic like me.
2005-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	ogra	sjoerd: in the gallery ?
2005-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	sjoerd	http://www.grawert.net/mataro/img113.jpeg.html

2005-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	ogra	sjoerd: for fabio, he was so impressed
2005-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	Blackwell nope, but then again, just because you're not allergic, doesn't mean you're the first to run and participate ~_^
2005-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	sjoerd	hehe
2005-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	sjoerd	ogra: where was that again
2005-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	ogra	sjoerd: in the last bar before the big party
2005-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	sjoerd	oh right
2005-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	xevil	tha_gamemaster: get kernel-package and have fun...
2005-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	tha_gamemaster	xevil, thanks ^_^
2005-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	xevil	tha_gamemaster: did you use kernel-package with Debian?
2005-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	mdke	gtkpod takes bloody ages to add directories to the list
2005-01-01T01:13:00.000Z	mdke	anyone else use gtkpod?
2005-01-01T01:14:00.000Z	Tyche	Hey everyone
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	rwabel	I've just tested out the shadow feature of x.org. Looks nice, but the system gets unusable due to too much ressource usage.
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	ogra	rwabel: yep
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	ogra	rwabel: its a known issue.....
2005-01-01T01:15:00.000Z	Tyche	I'm setting up my ubuntu server and I'm looking for a simple yet nice looking CMS for my personal web site. Image gallery, news, web links...can you suggest anything?
2005-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	rwabel	ogra: I hear, didn't think that it would be so heavy ! but nice to see ;-)
2005-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	Pugio	Does anyone know of any way to determine whether my network card is working or not?
2005-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm having problems with getting it to connect to anything
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Pugio	The case is: I have a cable plugged into my router, the cable works fine on my laptop
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	mdke	Pugio, ifconfig
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	ogra_dogwalk	rwabel: it will get lighter and faster..... ita a matter of time ;)
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Tyche	pugio: can you do a ifconfig from cmd prompt
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Pugio	I did
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Pugio	hang on
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Pugio	let me switch the cable out
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	mdke	Pugio, does it show up?
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	rwabel	ogra: isn't it a problem with the opengl?
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Tyche	Any CMS that you guys use?
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Blackwell	"Pugio quit (Connection reset by peer)" ;)
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Blackwell	(not that cable, i hope)
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	mdke	Pugio, if it doesn't show up
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	ok
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	ogra_dogwalk	rwabel: rahter with the apps i think.....
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	had to switch the cable
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	mdke	try ifconfig -a
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm using the laptop's wireless
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	mdke	Tyche, what is cms?
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pozac	content management system
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	ifconfig eth0 shows up
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	but It can't connect to anything
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	rwabel	ogra: why with the apps? aren't the apps independent of it?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	and yet, I had just connected to you using the very same cable/connection
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: ping gets through?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	nope
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	nothing
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	SeFoKumA	yeah
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Tyche	mdke: A Content Management System. So that I can have a personal website with nice admin utilities to add news, images and links.
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	it doesn't even have an ip
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	and I can't figure out how to get it working
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	mdke	Pugio, how are you starting it?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: pinging what, some windows or firewalled box? what's the ip config of both? does it show a link on the router?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	ok
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	here's the deal
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	my network is mostly unfirewalled
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm pinging a Mac OS X machine
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	the eth0 card has no Ip address
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	the Ubuntu network settings control has the card
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: does that os x box respond to pings? make sure it does. have an ip address. no worky without, i guess.
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	but every time I click "Activate" it activates for a sec and then deactivates
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: maybe the system log shows why?
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	ok, the box does respond to pings
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	erm, which one?
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	(what's the command for that again?)
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: the one on the machine which fails to activate the network card.
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	right, what I meant was, where's that log located
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	i expect the system log shows which module is attempted to be loaded (if any) and why it fails.
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	woops
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: no idea :)
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	duh!
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	hang on
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	this is a standard ubuntu install
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	ok here we go
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	pkellow	does anyone know how to fix the broken package of the samba?
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	I got something
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	pkellow	i would greatly appreciate it
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: remove and install again?
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	pkellow	just the samba
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: or install a package from somewhere else? windows style admin approach, i know, but hey, might work. :)
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Pugio	It says: "localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	there's a whole bunch of those
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	with the last interval number changing each time
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	then it says "localhost dhclient: No DHCPOFFERS received
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: seems you should configure an ip address.
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Pugio	but I'm using a DHCP server
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	it goes offline because it is configured to use DHCP and fails to acquire an ip config that way, i guess.
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: <shrug> i'd do without dhcp first, just to make sure everything is ok without dhcp anyway.
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Pugio	right, but it's never done this before
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Pugio	ok, hang on
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	now it does. :)
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	pkellow	umm what is the last version of samba that works with ubunut
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	ubunut, nice one :)
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	i already tried to give it a static ip
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	but here goes again
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: ubuntu is debian, i hear. so...
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: tried and failed? or tried and succeeded, yet no change of state?
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	tried and failed
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	pkellow	i know its debian i was just wondering
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	butk, as I said, here goes again
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	ah, so get that manual ip configuration going first, i guess. :)
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: unless it says otherwise, we must assume that it is "100% compatible", i guess.
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Pugio	right, but that's not working either
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm at a loss
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	macewan	the ladies smile as macewan announces that he's back
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: you fail at configuring the ip address of your network card?
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	there's ladies in here? <drool>
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Pugio	well, it configures, (i'm using the ubuntu GUI for network config) but I still can't connect to anything
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	macewan	:)
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: post the ip config of both boxes.
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Pugio	ok
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Blackwell	or post somewhere, don't know if channel is okay. just don't flood.
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Pugio	it's only 3 fields
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Pugio	Dead Box: ip: 192.168.123.150 - subnet: 255.255.255.255.0 - gateway: 192.168.123.254
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	that subnet mask worries me.
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Pugio	Live Bod: ip: 192.168.123.172 - the rest is the same
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Pugio	erm
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	sorry
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	that's only 3 sets of 255
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	not four
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	:)
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	the DNS servers are also identical
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	as I said, it worked fine before
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	just not anymore
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	krischan	Hey, what application are available to play back MIDI files?
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: who provides the dhcp service?
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	Pugio	my router
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	Pugio	remember, it's hard configured now anyway
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Pugio	I have an Asante something or other router
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Pugio	it's worked ok before
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: does the router activity led light up when you fire up ping or the activation of the network interface?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	brute method to check, i know, but...
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: i assume the router provides dhcp service to the other boxes ok?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: the router/nic link leds are lit?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	hmm
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: using another port on the router doesn't change anything?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	they weren't
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	nope
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	but...
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	I think I got it
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	dumb dumb dumb me
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	well, no link no fun
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	you used the wrong port? ;)
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	no
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	this cable is slightly messed up
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	aha
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	it doesn't seat right in the slot
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	no spare to play with, eh?
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	fender	need some help, how do you get audio from a dvd? can't install dvdrip or ffmpeg. which would do the job.
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	it worked on the laptop
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	cause the slot was slightly smaller
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	nope, no spares
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	actually, this was my spare
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: get some, too cheap to miss
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	haha :)
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Pugio	i know
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	sgood1971	Can anyone tell me how to open a port?
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	sgood1971: run a software which listens on that port.
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	fender	need some help, how do you get audio from a dvd? can't install dvdrip or ffmpeg. which would do the job.
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Pugio	now, lets see if I can stuff something into this slot to seat it
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	fender: repeating is not friendly, esp. not at these intervals.
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	sgood1971	Blackwell: I am trying to run amule and I get a lowid because I need 4266 opened. I tried sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 4662 -j ACCEPT but it still is not open.
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: try to switch cables around, if that is an option. configure the interface back, too, i guess.
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	sgood1971: haha, alright. no clue about linux firewall stuff, sorry.
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	fender	does anyone know how to get audio from a dvd on to my hard drive?
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	hello mrs. ubuntu :)
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	fender: slightly rephrasing may still be considered repeating.
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	Pugio	well, I finally was able to kick someone else off of the other machine
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	Pugio	so, now I'm testing it with his cable and it works fine - of course
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	fender	blackwell:well, i want to know how to get audio from a dvd.
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	sgood1971	fender: There is a thread on http://linuxquestions.org that covers dvd-shrink using wine.
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pugio	but, the cable works on his machine (the "dead" one)
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pugio	so everythings great now:)
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pugio	thanks for the help
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	fender	sgood1971:thank you, i'll try it.
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	sgood1971	fender: just use the search and look for dvd shrink
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	macewan	fender: mplayer does this I believe
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	fender	yeah, i think it uses ffmpeg. well, i think it does. but i can't get ffmpeg, failed dependencies
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender http://www.digital-digest.com, they have some linux software there, otherwise mplayer and transcode (if you want to do some well worth-while learning). Also there is DVD::RIP for linux.
2005-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	tha_game|away	(mplayer/mencoder)
2005-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	fender	i know about dvdrip, used it on freebsd, can't get to work on ubuntu, dependencies is a nightmare when trying to install dvdrip on suse. tried downloading transcode, same problem with that, failed dependencies.
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	fender	downloaded mplayer through apt-get and it doesn't work, doesn't load.
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	macewan	why are sound blaster cards such a bitch with ubuntu??
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender intersting, I used to use dvdrip through mandrake and had no problems...
2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan pci or isa?
2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	macewan	pci
2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan, hrm, I haven't tried it myself but I will be trying it soon, pci should be no problem...
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	fender	if you got to dvdrip's website it needs 10 or more dependencies including mplayer.
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, and ubuntu/debian doesn't have all the binary dependencies?
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	macewan	two different sound blaster types were tried, both barfed in different ways.
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	fender	well, i've only started using ubuntu and i think it
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan, ya got me, I've still  not messed with it on ubuntu.
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	fender	is a pleasure to use.
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	macewan	true pleasure, I use it at work.
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, I agree with you completely as I am in the same situation.  I'll be trying what you're doing in the next couple of days, if you have not gotten it to work by then and I am successful, I will guide you through it.
2005-01-01T01:49:00.000Z	fender	ok
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	lexhider	does anyone else not have a logout menu item in hoary?
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	jlund	I''m trying to add a program to the existing 'Internet' group in the Applications menu but going to 'applications://' in nautilus is giving me an error. How do I manually add a program?
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	macewan	compiling latest alsa-driver, should i compile oss emulation
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	fender	i got the audio from an mpeg file, using ffmpeg, but you need to use a few commands in the terminal or shell.
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	tha_game|away	nrn
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	tha_game|away	brb*
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	cardador	lexhider: that happens to me normally after a dist-upgrade. try ro restart x, or reboot.
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	macewan	lexhider: never had that while i used hoary
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	magnon	me neither
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	lexhider	interesting, I've currently had to put a logout applet on panel.
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	fender	i got the audio from an mpeg file in freebsd, only problem is i'm trying to get the audio from the source...DVD.
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	fender	in ubuntu.
2005-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	lexhider	I'll see if I can rectify
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	jlund	I'm trying to add a program to the existing 'Internet' group in the Applications menu but going to 'applications://' in nautilus is giving me an error. How do I manually add a program?
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	macewan	just right click from the menu itself
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	jlund	That closes the Applications list
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	jlund	I am on Hoary, dunno if that matters
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender let me install ffmpeg and see if i can do it.
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	macewan	applications > Internet 'right click in the Internet menu on top of one of the existing 'net apps'
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	macewan: that closes the launcher
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: its currently not possible in hoary
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	oh
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	Why is that?
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: because its hoary
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: its in steady development
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	fender	the_game|way: go to http://www.bunkus.org/dvdripping4linux/en/separate/tricks.html for some information, it might be a little bit useful.
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Hm, seems like a weird thing to not be able to do
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: be happy that nothing essential is currently broken ;)
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Oh well, I just added a little icon for it which works
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Yes, I am very happy with hoary
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	I'm glad it's not just me!
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Thanks
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: it will get fixed.....
2005-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, checking...
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, yea that's what i was gunna recommend but you can't get mplayer installed.
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	jlund	ogra - I have no doubt of that. I will keep doing updates and dist-upgrades :)
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	ogra	;)
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	kergan	is it ok i do a sysinfo script in here

2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kergan	i am trying to get ppl on my irc network to convert to ubuntu
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kergan	specaly for the irc servers
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kergan	ubuntu is far stabler than suse
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	dataw0lf	good for you.
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	imka	kergan it's not hard to convince some1 for ubuntu :)
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	kergan	i agree
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	kergan	the 1 person i was trying to convert was wanting to try gentoo
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	dataw0lf	so it's not much of an announcement.
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	kergan	and i talked him out of it
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	tha_game|away	has anyone successfully installed mplayer on ubuntu?
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	kergan	me
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	imka	tha_game yes, earlier
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	kergan	but it dont work like it should
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	imka	but it wouldnt work with my new install
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	tha_game|away	imka, I'm trying to get fender some help with installation, can't find anything in the wiki...
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	imka	i think its because of package conflicts. i have totem-xine with w32codecs and libdvdcss and it works like a charm. gnome look and feel rulz
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kergan	i like the gnome-xine
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	tha_game|away	yea but we need the mplayer for some video editing.
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	kergan	tha_game|away,  cant you use xine
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	ogra	tha_game|away: tried kino for that ?
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	imka	tha_game if you really want it, you need to add a line to sources.list
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	tha_game|away	orga kino doesn't use mpeg2 video (especially not of the vob calibur)
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	tha_game|away	kergan xine for video editing?
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	tha_game|away	brb
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	imka	tha_game what kinda video editing. just cutting or what?
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	imka: vob indicates video cd
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	bob2	vob indicates dvd
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: hey bob
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: home again ?
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	imka	ah okay, vob. sry
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	bob2	yeah, only took...35 hours
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	bob2	including a missed flight
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	ogra	:-O
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Gwildor	hello :)
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Gwildor	i just installed enlightenment, and, before, i have installed other WM that didnt make it to the <session> menu at the log in screen
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	ogra	but at least you got it warm there
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	sulkd	imka: I got w32 codecs in /usr/lib/win32 and still totem isn't showing wmvs.. how'd you configure it?
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Gwildor	any idea how to add them
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	just don't use totem
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	install mplayer or gxine
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	imka	use totem-xine
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	lexhider	well, I still haven't got a logout menu thing, I'll just hope it returns in a dist-upgrade in the future.
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	totem-xine is a waste of your time
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	imka	the default totem uses gstreamer, which kinda sucks
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	a simple rhyme to give you...lime
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: hmm, never had probs with it
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	imka	bob2 i guess its a matter of preference. it works for me
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	gstreamer is prohibited by law from being awesome
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	imka	lol
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: lol
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	imka: ogra you guys won't come complaining here when your hoary upgrade breaks, tho
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	other people will, since they don't know what ubuntu-desktop is for
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: i know what to do ;)
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	imka	bob2 do you really think a missing ubuntu-desktop will break things? im not sure
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	ogra	btw, vlc is a good tool too
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	ogra	imka: it will !
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	bob2	imka: lack of gamin on hoary makes things irritatingly slow
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	imka	well, in that case, i just install ubuntu-desktop be4 upgrading and then reinstall totem-xine
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	imka	but why would it break it?
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	Blackwell	grmblfx, doesn't use the keyboard layout i specified at install time, grrr
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	kergan	i never had the prob of missing ubuntu-desktop
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	imka	kergan, r u running hoary?
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	kergan	yes
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	imka	cool
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	Blackwell	that's...not nice when trying to login with the non ascii char containing password you so cleverly chose...
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	mike998	just say I wanted to try running hoary but didnk'
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	ogra	night all
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	imka	night
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	kergan	and it works just as well ass the werty
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	mike998	t want to reinstall my warty...  could I do it by changing my repositories?
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	bob2	mike998: you can move to hoary from warty without reinstalling, but not the other way round
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	sulkd	heh.. ubuntu-desktop is just a virtual package.. it gets "removed" in your dist-upgrade whenever a package it represents is removed, like when they refactor some of the Ubuntu specific stuff and a package gets thrown out or renamed
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	sulkd: no it dopesn't
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	sulkd	the entire thing doesnt get removed when you see that
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	imka	well, i keep hearing this and that how important ubuntu-desktop is. but people who don't have it and upgraded say it 's okay
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	fender	can't believe it, need audio from a dvd, totem plays audio and no video. lol.
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	imka: yes, it's fine to remove it, if you know what it does
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	mike998	bob2: clarify for me... Hoary is gonna be the next release, right?  or was it the last release?
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	imka	yea, it's just a meta package
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	kergan	fender,  check for the dvdcss
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	imka: encouraging "newbies" to remove it means they will get lost and broken systems at some point in the future
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	mike998: next
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	imka	bob2 aight sir, i shut up LOL
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	bob2	mike998: but it's under very heavy development, don't upgrade unless you can handle a broken system and don't mind things changing a lot
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	fender	i havwe got dvdcss, i played the dvd earlier with ogle.
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	kergan	hmm
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	kergan	check your vidoe settings
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	imka	i'm off for a cigarette
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	mike998	bob2: I was considering doing so in order to challenge myself a little more and force myself to learn more
2005-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	mike998	cheers, anyway
2005-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	kergan	fender manke shure it outputting the video to the right source devise

2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	LostMonk	what about some word docs that i have, is there gonna be anyway to transfer them over to linux?
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	bob2	you don't normally need to install drivers under linux
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Adrenal	if u have the oppurtuntiy to go back
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Adrenal	u will

2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	kergan	LostMonk, openoffice will read any doc you throw at it
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	bob2	Adrenal: lots of people choose linux over windows on it's merits, rather than because they have to
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	bob2	LostMonk: openoffice can read msot any word document
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, open office, itll open your text doc's
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	kergan	and mso documents

2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, if you want to be 100% sure you will still be able to read your doc's, you can install open office in windows, and try to open them all
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	scoon	and see if open office works they way you like it.
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, it did for me
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	bob2	LostMonk: depends how it's setup

2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	Crane	is this your first time with linux Monk
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	Crane	?

2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	miggumike	i don't see where it explains how to automount a partition when i bootup
2005-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	Crane	I've tried many distros and had very little prob connecting
2005-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	cef	LostMonk: you're on cable? dhcp and the like? no special program to log you in or anything?
2005-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	mike998	miggumike take a look at your /etc/fstab file
2005-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	LostMonk	icable

2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	mike998	actually if I were you I would actually create a mount point (the /share directory in my case)
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	cef	miggumike: umask is the reverse of permissions so a umask of 000 = chmod 777, umask of 022 = chmod 755, etc.
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	kergan	or /mnt/share

2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	nigg	I was made aware of Ubuntu by a friend who ordered a CD from the site. He assured me that Ubuntu was speedy and light on resources. Can anyone confirm this?
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	cef	miggumike: chmod is a way of changing permissions. you have 3 groups of access 'User', 'Group' and 'Others'. Each one of these groups can have 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' permission.
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	Marble2	kergan:  why not
2005-01-01T03:35:00.000Z	Marble2	my mouse3 doesn't work for scrolling up and down in firefox

2005-01-01T03:59:00.000Z	mike998	billy gives the consumers crap and they close their eyes and swallow it
2005-01-01T03:59:00.000Z	Crane	I think by default it stores only the last 500 commands
2005-01-01T03:59:00.000Z	_jon_	does anybody have a radeon 9200 who's running warty?
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	Marble2	thanks crane

2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	Marble2	from 500?
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	socomm	So longhorn is the next release of X Windows?
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	Crane	no prob

2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	_jon_	beat you rolfzor
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	Blackwell	mike998: i love my xp. but i will probably never understand the version junkies, whatever os they may prefer.
2005-01-01T04:00:00.000Z	rolfzor	_jon_ :)
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	mike998	Blackwell: I do actually understand it, and sometimes I am guilty of it
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	rolfzor	Blackwell: last time I installed xp I got spyware before the installation was finished :)
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	Crane	umm hang on I checking
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	Marble2	ok
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	mike998	rolfzor: I have heard that many times... were you firewalled?
2005-01-01T04:01:00.000Z	Marble2	what if it's root?
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	Marble2	there is no home directory for that
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	Blackwell	rolfzor: yeah, you have to know what you are doing. besides, some people consider xp contacting time.microsoft.com a proof for spyware in xp.
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	Blackwell	<tongue in cheek>
2005-01-01T04:02:00.000Z	_jon_	Marble2: the home directory for root is /root/
2005-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	Marble2	thanks
2005-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	Crane	Marble2: not real sure, type env in your console for a list of veriables
2005-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	Crane	you should see one called HISTFILE=
2005-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	Crane	That is how many commands can be stored
2005-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	Crane	Mine is set at 10000
2005-01-01T04:03:00.000Z	cef	prak: re: disabling mouse gestures. I don't have it at all, but you might try opening firefox, and in the url bar type 'about:config' and looking thru the options.. double clicking on a line will alter the option

2005-01-01T04:07:00.000Z	mitochondyu	i alwats get segmentation fault
2005-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	aeruder	mitochondyu: well, it could be a gcc bug
2005-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	aeruder	but sometimes as well, it ends up being a problem with your RAM
2005-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	kergan	mitochondyu,  thay might be in the middel of initizling the status function still
2005-01-01T04:08:00.000Z	aeruder	so you might try a memtest86... but usually that's only the case when sometimes it succeeds, and others it fauls
2005-01-01T04:09:00.000Z	Crane	Are you running ubuntu?
2005-01-01T04:09:00.000Z	mitochondyu	T.T all i want is my epson driver, then am all done,

2005-01-01T04:10:00.000Z	mitochondyu	i think is the cannon backend causing the error
2005-01-01T04:10:00.000Z	kergan	compile the cannon back end first
2005-01-01T04:10:00.000Z	kergan	then compile all of it

2005-01-01T04:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79	I'm getting this strange error when trying to connect to a specific IRC server: http://www.pastebin.com/131803
2005-01-01T04:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79	All other servesr (like this one) are fine
2005-01-01T04:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79	But AfterNet gives that error
2005-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Any ideas? =/ I've tried reading the manual, but the manual's all about mIRC and I'm on X-Chat >>
2005-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	kergan	Hikaru79,  conver that manuel to xchat and see what happends
2005-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	kergan	convert
2005-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	Hikaru79	I can't -- the manual calls for changing the e-mail address. X-chat doesn't even ask for your e-mail address o_O;
2005-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	Quest-Master	How is it possible to stream MP3s with XMMS, inside Firefox?
2005-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	rolfzor	Hikaru79: press ctrl+s and change "User name:" to something in lowercase
2005-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	kergan	Quest-Master,  using like shoutcast??
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Sort of
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	Quest-Master	But I'd like to be able to play MP3s inside Firefox
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	kergan	save the .pls file to your hdd
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79	There's no "user name" field, although there is a "Real Name" field, and I changed that to 'adrian' which is all lower-case
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	kergan	and open it in xmms
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Without downloading them, or opening a new XMMS instance
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Just directly in Firefox.
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	kergan	then get a plugin for firefox
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	kergan	but xmms must be open for that plugin to work
2005-01-01T04:27:00.000Z	kergan	you can minize xmms
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	Crane	Hikaru79: have you connected to it with mirc with no problem?
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	rolfzor	Hikaru79: try editing ~/.xchat2/xchat.conf, and change "irc_user_name".. its on line 101 here
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	Crane	It could be a server problem
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Oh, never mind guys :) The guys in #xchat helped me out
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	Crane	cool
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	kergan	cool
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	Crane	Well I hope you guys don't mind me hanging out even though I'm not using ubuntu

2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	usual	Crane, did you bring beer
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Crane, Ubuntu is renowned for it's friendliness ;)
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	Quest-Master	Windoze? Or another Linux distro, Crane?
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Hikaru79	But, yeah, beer has to be involved, of course.

2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	usual	So where ya from Jason?
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	Hikaru79	rolfzor, true. Especially in Canada. The land of beer :D

2005-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	PD	Hi ppl
2005-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	cef	hi there
2005-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	Crane	howdy
2005-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	PD	When I log into KDE in ubuntu it says can not access /dev/dsp
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	PD	What should I do
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	aeruder	ignore it unless you want sound ;)
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	PD	:)
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	Riddell	PD: is your using in the audio group?  (run `groups` from a console)
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	PD	But I want sound
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	aeruder	PD: the first thing is to fire up a console... try cat /dev/dsp > /dev/null
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	PD	it only says pd when I run groups
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	aeruder	what error does it give you ?
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	aeruder	ah, permission denied then :)
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	PD	It says permission denied
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	crimsun	sudo adduser pd audio
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	aeruder	yea, you need to open /etc/group
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	aeruder	er, yea, i guess adduser can do it too :)
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	aeruder	i always forget about that, heh
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	crimsun	then you need to log out and back in
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	PD	ok let me try it
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	aeruder	PD: while you are at it
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	aeruder	do a adduser pd cdrom
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	aeruder	adduser pd floppy
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	aeruder	adduser pd video
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	aeruder	that should be good for most of the common things
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	PD	Okei I'll log out and come back innnn
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	paulproteus	aeruder: You should advise him to use the GUI tool available in Computer -> System configuration -> Users and Groups
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: why?
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	paulproteus	That way, he'll become acquainted with the GUI tools if he prefers them.
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	aeruder	and if he doesn't?
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	paulproteus	Maybe "advise him to" is too strong; but point him to it as well, at least.
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: if he had asked how to open a console, i'd have thought about teaching him the gnome-specific way
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	aeruder	not that i would even know the gnome-specific way :)
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	paulproteus	There are a lot of new Linux users I've been talking to who want more GUI tools to do things, even if there's a command-line available.
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: but in general, the adduser method will work on all distros and perhaps on other os's
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: and then cripple them when they have to do something with command line?
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: a little command line never hurt anyone ;)
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	calc	x is just meant to be a way to run more xterms
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	aeruder	calc: thank you!
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	aeruder	heh
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	calc	:)
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	paulproteus	calc: That's not how lots of users see GNU/Linux, though I do have that position sometimes.
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	paulproteus	Basically, this is the big advantage of Ubuntu over most other distros: Well-integrated GUI tools.
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	calc	if dos wasn't a pos the same would be of windows
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	cendrizzi	Hi all, anyone use the ati drivers?
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: that's not how many see it, but at the same time i don't see the point on teaching a user how to do it the "GNOME" way
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	aeruder	and then when they try XFCE they have to fire up gnome to add people to groups
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	PD	thanks guys its working now
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	paulproteus	aeruder: So they can feel less like, "Linux is a frustrating experience."
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	cendrizzi	I'm trying to setup laptop mode
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	aeruder	or when they try a different distro, they are screwed
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	calc	gui's are slower than console for most things, of course word processing, web browsing are useful to have a gui
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	aeruder	PD: was that in any way frustrating?
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	aeruder	hehe
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	PD	nope that was a cake walk
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	aeruder	PD: you're starting a flamewar ;)
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	calc	unless you like typing docbook directly in vim ;)
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	paulproteus	(PD: As an aside, you can do this from the GUI, too: Computer -> System settings -> Users and Groups.)
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	aeruder: maybe *for some people*, the GUI is a path to the CLI ?
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	kergan	Xenguy,  i agree
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	cendrizzi	anyone?  ati drivers?  Hopefully on a laptop?
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	kergan: some people will *never* take to the CLI (altho I'm not really sure why that is)
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	PD	I tried installing ubuntu on my friendslaptop but it crashed
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	kergan	i used the gui then started using the cli casue it was more powerfull
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	aeruder	Xenguy: *perhaps*... however, with many system conf issues with gui's, they are different from distro to distro, not to mention they are different from desktop to desktop, and then they are different from version to version
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	aeruder	so why not teach people the way that will stick around?
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	calc	i use the regular x.org driver for my 9600 but thats also because there is no amd64 driver at all for it
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	Crane	hey guys, got to go
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	PD	I tried stoppoing services an all that, finally I gave up
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	Crane	I'll swing in tomorrow night
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	aeruder: sure, which is why learning the 'low-level' tools is best ;-)
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	Crane	later
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	paulproteus	cendrizzi: There's probably some info on the forums, but I have no personal experience with it.
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	Xenguy	aeruder: but I guess in the end it depends on your specific audience at any given time
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	aeruder	Xenguy: in my experience, most somewhat-technically inclined people would rather be shown how to do it via the command-line (or even told, hey, you can directly edit /etc/group) than to use some magic gui that is gone when they install redhat
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	calc	that is why the tools need to be part of the desktop itself not part of the dist
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	cendrizzi	paulproteus, I'm coming here because I'm not getting help there :(
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	aeruder: I agree - and then there are those who are not 'tekkies', and want the GUI comfort zone
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	calc	eg g-s-t
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	paulproteus	cendrizzi: Ah.
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	aeruder	calc: yes, and then when they use KDE instead of gnome?
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	calc	shoot them to put them out of their misery? ;)
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	aeruder: or perhaps what they think is the comfort zone ;-)
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	paulproteus	aeruder: It's in the KDE Control Center, actually.
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	aeruder	or a slower machine and decide that they want to run blackbox or fluxbox?
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	paulproteus	Not hard to find.
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	paulproteus	aeruder: And it's certainly a good idea to teach them the command-line version, too.
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	cendrizzi	paulproteus, It's really dumb, you can setup laptop mode, to toggle between external monitor and lcd but I have no idea how to actually toggle
2005-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	cendrizzi	there is no docs on it
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	aeruder	paulproteus: well, *I* for one will not be showing people how to do it via the GUI
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	calc	the kde admin tools looked pretty bad the last time i looked at them, and aren't nearly as complete
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	cendrizzi	ATI certainly doesn't have any
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	crimsun	command line first. gui tools after.
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	aeruder: No problem. :)
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	aeruder	and that is that.. so feel free to interject with how to do it via the GUI
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	aeruder	<-- doesn't use gnome/kde ;)
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	calc	aiui kalyxo is working on fixing the kde tools
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	kergan	i use my seti@home in cli casue its easer to set up that way
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	calc: Oh, good. :)
2005-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	calc	would be cool to abstract the backend of g-s-t and just have both gnome and kde frontends to that
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	tar`	'lo all.
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	kergan	high tar`
2005-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	paulproteus	gnome-system-tools, got it.
2005-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	paulproteus	I thought you were saying something about gstreamer, calc.
2005-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	calc	oh sorry, yea gnome-system-tools
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	Riddell	calc: the backend is abstracted and there's already a KDE frontend to the network configuration stuff that needs to be investigated
2005-01-01T05:22:00.000Z	tar`	Where has Ubuntu been all my life? :P
2005-01-01T05:23:00.000Z	davyd	tar`: hidden in a pit of tar we call Debian ;)
2005-01-01T05:24:00.000Z	calc	Riddell: great
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	tuggy1	the best linux distro!
2005-01-01T05:29:00.000Z	tuggy1	and I have tried ALOT of them
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	tar`	Now to figure this Tomcat dealie out :P
2005-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	tuggy1	just tried PCLOS beta8... its nice

2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	kergan	you can format the drive and have it mount some whare later
2005-01-01T05:33:00.000Z	cef	hrm, does ubuntu actually fit in 1 gig by itself

2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	cef	tar`: that doens't help the average desktop user
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	tuggy1	quest... I know people have had luck with mozplugger I think
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	lostmonk	well, if i can get it to install on the small drive, ill reinstall on the bigger if i gotta
2005-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	lostmonk	i dunno if the iso was bad or what
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	lostmonk	whats the link for the site?
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	tar`	I had a 1.4 GB drive and by passing the option to tell it not to copy the package files, it fit until I rebooted and began the second half of installation :-\
2005-01-01T05:35:00.000Z	kergan	www.ubuntulinux.org
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	tar`	Not that it's all that important now that I got rid of that laptop. ;)
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	tar`	Has anyone here installed Tomcat in Ubuntu?
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	lostmonk	warty-release-install-i386.iso
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	lostmonk	thats what i want right?
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Quest-Master	There's a bug in the mozilla-dev package so I can't compile mozilla-mplayer for some reason
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	davyd	libpanel-applet2-doc doesn't install actual documentation it seems
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	Quest-Master	*bug in the mozilla-dev package for Debian and Ubuntu
2005-01-01T05:37:00.000Z	kergan	lostmonk,  yes
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	lostmonk	well, here goes another 20 minutes of downloading
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	lostmonk	:P
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	kergan	lol
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	lostmonk	what makes ubuntu better than KDE?
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	lostmonk	since i have all this time
2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	tuggy1	lostmonk they are too differant things
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	tuggy1	ubuntu is a distro
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	kergan	kde = gui
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	lostmonk	i thought ubuntu was just a kind of gnome
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	tuggy1	kde is a desktop manager/resource hog/everything else they pack in
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	tuggy1	no
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	kergan	ubuntu uses gnome primarly
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	tuggy1	gnome is just a desktop manager
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	kergan	as a gui
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	tuggy1	like explorer is to windows
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	Rene_S	Well for one thing Gnome seems to use less resources
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	kergan	sorry i am wrong gui = xserver
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lostmonk	so ubuntu is more like red hat, etc
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	tuggy1	yeah
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lostmonk	so a sorta "brand"
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	kergan	yeah
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	tuggy1	yep
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lostmonk	but they will all use the same apps?
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	kergan	flavors we call them
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	kergan	prity much
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lostmonk	hehe
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	Rene_S	The second reason is that its philosophy is nice
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	lostmonk	like i heard about kopete<sp?>
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	kergan	thats for kde desktop
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	tuggy1	kopete is the kde chat client
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	lostmonk	does ubuntu have something like that?
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	tuggy1	gnome has GAIM (better)
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	lostmonk	ahhhh
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	kergan	gaim= im
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	lostmonk	so i cant use kde stuff then
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	tuggy1	ask anyone and they will tell you that
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	kergan	instant messanger
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	tuggy1	sure you can
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	kergan	gnome has xchat tuggy1
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	tuggy1	you just need some KDE files
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	tuggy1	not for IM
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: you can use kde stuff, if you want
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	tuggy1	Xchat is for IRC
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	bob2	but they won't be as well integrated into the system as gnome ones generally are
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	tuggy1	GAIM is for AIM MSN Yahoo Jabber
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	lostmonk	but does kde stuff cause issues on ubu?
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	tar`	Man, you guys are loud... I need more tolerable Gaim sounds.
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	tuggy1	lostmonk, not really
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	lostmonk	not really isnt comforting :P
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	tuggy1	but the only good KDE app is k3b
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	tar`	Isn't there a FAQ that answers lostmonk's questions? These seem pretty general to me.
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	adbak	i use AIM sounds for gaim.  i got them back when i used my windows partition
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	lostmonk	im just stuck waiting for the iso to download again
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	tuggy1	not really means... it doesnt always looks as pritty, might have a bug here or there
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	lostmonk	mIRC is now the only app on my system
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Quest-Master	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?goto=newpost&t=8783
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	tuggy1	any one else here try Freesbie?
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	adbak	in xchat, what are those two bars below the member list for?
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	tar`	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/faqfolder_view <- Includes "Do you support KDE?" "Which packages are available in Ubuntu?" etc.
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	Rene_S	one for lag
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	Rene_S	not sure about the other
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	Rene_S	says its a throttle meter
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	tuggy1	hey can someone go here: http://www.freesbie.org/images/freesbie11-2.jpg and tell me what system monitor that is in the top right
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	kergan	lag and amount transvered
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	tar`	So I guess it's so you don't flood?
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	Rene_S	that might come in handy if my wife doesn't stop spending my money
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	kergan	no
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	tar`	tuggy1: I saw that earlier today and couldn't figure out what it was either. :)
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	lostmonk	what is apt-get?
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	kergan	i use gkrellm for my system montor
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	tar`	tuggy1: It looked more elegant in the desktop I saw it in :P
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	adbak	apt-get is the backbone for synaptic.  it's basically the command line interface for downloading and installing programs
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	kergan	lostmonk,  its kinda like rpm -i some.rpm
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	lostmonk	wow
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	kergan	yep
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	tar`	lostmonk: Do you have previous Linux experience?
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	lostmonk	i guess i really got a lot to learn
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	tuggy1	apt-get is the greatest thing ever invented
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	lostmonk	none
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	Adrenal	i just reinstall ubuntu(don't ask)
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	tar`	Any alternative OS experience? ;)

2005-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	tar`	lostmonk: I installed Ubuntu (Warty) and had a working system without any configuration; plus, with synaptic, you don't even need the terminal to easily install new applications.
2005-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	lostmonk: the apt-get commands are pretty basic once you catch on
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	lostmonk: or there's synaptic
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	tar`	tuggy1: I just hate how every time I want to do something new, I have to go learn how to do it. When I don't really care about the internals, clicking a box for DHCP is good enough.
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	kergan	far more supior the the rpm based distros
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	lostmonk	now, when i had the bootstarp error earlier, it said something about burning the disc slower??
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	lostmonk	should i do that this time around?
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	tar`	It's worth a shot.
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	tar`	I assume it said your disc was a bad burn?
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	lostmonk	i gotta dig for my burner app now
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	tuggy1	tar`, I agree with you there, the one thing ubuntu needs is a control center like yast2 or the one in yoper
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	speel	lol
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	lostmonk	yeah, said there was a del bootstrap, something like that
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	tuggy1	do that you can config certain things quickly
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	kergan	i just like the fast if some thing freazes x(god forbid) it dont take the whole system down like it would with winshit
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Adrenal	how do i select something?
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Adrenal	what key?
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	Hikaru79	Any sourceforge users around here? I tried registering this morning (twice!) and I still haven't gotten the confirmation letter. It's been about 12 hours already. Is this normal?
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	kergan	Hikaru79,  yes
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	kergan	can take up to 24-48 hrs
2005-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	tuggy1	I love yoper... I hope they find their way into success, Its one of the few distros that could take me away from ubuntu
2005-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	adbak	i tried to install yoper, but for some reason it wouldn't take to my cpu
2005-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	tuggy1	what cpu?
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	lostmonk	what about knoppix?
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	adbak	dell dimension 4800 i think
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	tuggy1	hmm
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	adbak	p4 2ghz 512mb
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	adbak	no biggie, i love ubuntu
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	tar`	Knoppix can be fun, although *it* doesn't like my system. ;)
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	yeah I love ubuntu too
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	I need to stop going to distrowatch
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	adbak	hehe
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	lostmonk	my GF was wanting to know if there was any kind of windows emulator for running windows apps
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	adbak	i wish i would have found distrowatch earlier in my linux days
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	it always makes me want to try new distros, only to remeber why I use ubuntu
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	lostmonk
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	speel	lostmonk: use winehq
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	lostmonk, yeah wine
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	kergan	lostmonk,  ya wine
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	adbak	lostmonk: are you trying to wean her off of windows?
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	speel	but half the time things dont work well so eh its give or take ... why what kind of stuff she wants to run?
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	lostmonk	i gotta ewan myself off
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	tuggy1	hey does anyone know if you can use cedega to run win apps other then games?
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	lostmonk	i have no idea
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	kergan	ask her then
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	speel	lol
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	lostmonk	i know shes gonna miss her amarang
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	lostmonk	:)
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	tuggy1	lostmonk, there is nothing windows has that linux doesnt, except commercial 3d games
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	lostmonk	brb
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	kergan	most any thang  thats out for win is eather ported to linux or linux allready has an equilivant
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	adbak	or linux already has a superior
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	kergan	that too
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	adbak	anyone know if hoary will come with reiser4 support?
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	tuggy1	maybe I should try installing a non game with cedega... see if it works
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	kergan	adbak,  yes
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	tar`	adbak: Is that stable?
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	nictuku	IMHO some stuff run slower on linux, like mozilla firefox and most "graphical" apps.
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	bob2	kergan: how do you know that?
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	adbak	i do believe it's stable
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	bob2	reiser4 isn't in a mainline kernel yet
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	kergan	its in the kernel modules list
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	tuggy1	mozzila runs just fine on linux for me
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	tuggy1	nictuku, how fast is your comp?
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	SimonTek	anyone in the SE georgia area need work?
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	nictuku	you'd notice the difference if you were on a k6 300 with 128mb of ram :)
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	tar`	Firefox doesn't handle opening zillions of tabs at once as well in Linux as it does in Windows for me.
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	nictuku	and I'm even running fluxbox instead of gnome
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	tuggy1	you should be using vector linux
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	adbak	i'm on a k6 350 with 128mb ram
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	adbak	:)
2005-01-01T06:03:00.000Z	tuggy1	or DSL
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	adbak	wb lostmonk
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	they are much better for slow old compters
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	nictuku	vector linux?
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	nictuku	tar, I agree.
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	(time to upgrade)
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	speel	old comps stricktly deli linux
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	lostmonk	how slow should i burn this copy of the iso?
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	kergan	4x
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	speel	what is it?
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	kergan	or 16x
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	i burn my ISOs at like 32x
2005-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	52x here
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	no problems
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	lostmonk	i did burn it at 32x
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	tuggy1	never miss burn even with my super cheap CDr
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	kergan	i burn mine as fast as the media will go
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	bob2	it depends on the media and the drive
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	tuggy1	my dvd burner tops out at 32x
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	kergan	i installed werty using a cd-rw disk
2005-01-01T06:05:00.000Z	bob2	some old drives have problems with data cds burnt at high speeds
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	lostmonk	im just gonna try it slower like it suggested
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	lostmonk	maybe its these cheap cd's i have
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	lostmonk	:)
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	kergan	lol
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	kergan	ya or you just got the one bad disk in the bunch
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	lostmonk	10$ for 50\
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	nictuku	it depends on the speed of the processor and amount of ram available, too. I can't burn at 8x or I'd get a buffer underrun.
2005-01-01T06:06:00.000Z	tuggy1	I paid 5 bucks for my 50 stack of CDr
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	nictuku	:)
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	lostmonk	is there a list anywhere for apps available for ubu?
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	tuggy1	but I work for a computer store and get them almost at cost
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	lostmonk	hehe
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	lostmonk	i wish
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	kergan	i payed 20 for my stack of memorex 100 cd-rs
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	lostmonk	not too bad
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	lostmonk	ida done that
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: yes, but it won't really help you
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: since it's 12 000 items long
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	20 for 150 52x cdr
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	tuggy1	lost.. anything you can find linux source files for will run on ubuntu
2005-01-01T06:07:00.000Z	lostmonk	ikes
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	lostmonk	i wouldnt know what to do with linux source files
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	tuggy1	plus the 8000 apps in the deb repos
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lol
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	you don't need to use source
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	kergan	just to compile it
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	once you've installed ubuntu, just have a look in synaptic
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	you don't need to compile anything
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	lostmonk	i was looking at screenshots for something, and it showed like a weather update thing
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	tuggy1	bob2, unless you want mplayer
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	kergan	lostmonk,  thats in ubuntu
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	lostmonk	cool
2005-01-01T06:08:00.000Z	bob2	tuggy1: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats, please don't spread FUD
2005-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	kergan	i have mine up as we speek

2005-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	lostmonk	that was one of my fav things on trillian
2005-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	lostmonk	instant weather before i left for work
2005-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	kergan	ya its called evolution
2005-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lostmonk, do you mean like outlook express?
2005-01-01T06:09:00.000Z	lostmonk	maybe my gmail will work with that, since it wouldnt with outlook
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	lostmonk	yeah
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	thunderbird is good
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	kergan	then its called thunderbird
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	mozilla.org
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	rolfzor	lostmonk: gmail works great in evolution
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	yea it does
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	lostmonk	good
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	lostmonk	today my outlook updated for the first time in 3 weeks
2005-01-01T06:10:00.000Z	lostmonk	:P
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	tuggy1	bob2, now your stuff before you get on peoples case... there have been problems installing mplayer
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	kergan	lol
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	nictuku	will preseeds support be added to the next ubuntu release installer?
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	bob2	tuggy1: er, um, ok
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	kergan	nictuku,  whats that
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	bob2	tuggy1: the only problems I've seen are from people failing to follow the instructions
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bob2, true
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	bob2	tuggy1: can you point me to a specific problem so it can be fixed?
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	lostmonk	well, im gonna try this again here
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	nictuku	auto-install, for mass installations.
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	lostmonk	if i have issues, ill be back again :P
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	kergan	lol
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	kergan	cya
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	lostmonk	hopefully, ill just be back
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	tuggy1	if I come across it again.. no problem
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	nictuku: some people are working on it for d-i in debian, I imagine there's still tiem for it to make it into hoary if it's stable
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	tuggy1	and its not FUD
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	kergan	nictuku,  probly not
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	it is FUD
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	bob2	since the packages work fine for thousands of people
2005-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bob2, call it like it is man
2005-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	tuggy1	but we can also add that they are unsupported and not even in the ubuntu repos
2005-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	bob2	no, we can't
2005-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	bob2	since mplayer is in multiverse
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	nictuku	if when hoary releases the d-i is still "rc2", will it ship it?
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	mplayer rocks, even if a few people can't follow directions..
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	tuggy1	mplayer does rock
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	bob2	nictuku: warty shipped with d-i from before the first beta, iirc
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	adbak	gxine is a competent replacement for mplayer
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	SimonTek	is anyone from GA?
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	kergan	i think xine is better the mplayer
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	nictuku	rc2 has a pretty decent preseeds set.
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	tuggy1	best player for linux that I have used
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	kergan	but to each hisOR her own
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	bob2	SimonTek: the user list is probably a better place for questions like that
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	so where is that list guys
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er	xine is better than mplayer?
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	no
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	kergan	yes
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	they're both pretty much equivalent
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	Roshbo	Whats that weather thing called that Lost spoke about
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	nictuku	no, IMO.
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	SimonTek	I am curious if anyone wants to submit a resume. thats all
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	kergan	its in your add idam to your bar
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	adbak	burner: not necessarily.  depends on your tastes
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er	eh... i like mplayer's interface... that's about it
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	bob2	Roshbo: evolution used to be able to show weather forecasts.  theres a gnome panel applet for it now
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er	they both play about the same stuff
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	bob2	SimonTek: yes, I know, try the list
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	bur[n] er	vlc is actually really nice too
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	Roshbo	tks
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	bob2	SimonTek: the odds of finding any significant number of people from one specific state ine one random country at any time in here is small, compared to the list
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	adbak	i had problems with vlc, forget what they were
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	SimonTek	true
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	SimonTek	being lazy.

2005-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	lostmonk	couldnt retrieve bsdmainutils. This may be due to a network problem or a bad cd.
2005-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	there are a few others like that. invented to be as horrible as possible.

2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	rolfzor	ChrisC_: you have to install the mozilla-chatzilla package
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	bob2	kergan: that's not answering my question :)
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	ChrisC_	Aha!
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	kergan	lostmonk,  it is a good burn this time

2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	lostmonk	i burned at half the speed as the 1st time
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	kergan: no, that doesn't mean the cd is ok
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	kergan: that's a sign that the cd is *not* ok
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	rolfzor	Dko: np
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	kergan	bob2,  not in my expereance

2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	ChrisC_	Recommend a CPU/memory status tracker?  Like something that resides at the bottom of the screen somewhere.  Ubuntu approved, of course.
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	lostmonk	as long as its green, its compatible, right?
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	ChrisC_: gnome has a system monitor applet

2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	ChrisC_	hmmm, as soon as I installed the System Monitor panel, the mouse got jumpy
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	adbak	what are you trying to install/configure?
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	ChrisC_	removed it -> mouse smooth again
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	tuggy1, if you add the mplayerplug-in with mozplugger installed you get the controls in the mozilla player window
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	lostmonk	i restart with the cd in
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	lostmonk	and it never gets past base install
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: have you checked the cd burnt correctly yet?
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	tuggy1	mplayerplug-in?
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	lostmonk	ive reburnt it once already
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	yea
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	calamari	tuggy1: what's sad is that this 333MHz machine should be capable of that.. but linux is paintfully slow on it.
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	adbak	is your cd-drive reliable?  i had trouble installing ubuntu on this comp but that was due to a faulty cd-drive
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	calamari, did you mod hdparm?
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: no, that's not the same
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	lostmonk	never had issues with it before
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: check that the CD burnt correctly
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	lostmonk	how?
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	to speed up the HD access speeds
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	calamari	nomasteryoda: dunno.. not sure what that means :)
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	bob2	lostmonk: select 'check cd' from the installer menu
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	calamari	oh
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	bob2	or use md5sum on it
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	tuggy1	why wont this computer slow down!!!!
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	lostmonk	installer menu on the cd?
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	ChrisC_	hmm, it's the network component of the System panel that causes the jumpy mouse.  I wonder if that's a warning of network trouble (brand new install)
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	bob2	tuggy1: chill dude
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	tuggy1	246mb of ram used
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	tuggy1	sorry
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	adbak	lostmonk: try installing ubuntu again, but instead of hitting enter after your computer boots up, type 'custom-expert'
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	lostmonk	ok
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	look at this article... http://enterprise.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/12/14/166253&tid=89
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	lostmonk	then what?
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	for hdparm
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	er, the url that is
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	calamari	nomasteryoda: thanks, I appreciate that :)
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	adbak	then you'll have a list of options that you can use to check the cd or install various parts of ubuntu
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lostmonk, look at sudo lspci
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	lostmonk	ah, ok
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	lostmonk	sudo what?
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	sudo lspci   - lspci lists pci hw
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	tuggy1	I should get a screen shot of this when Im done
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	lostmonk	and what with the md5sum thing am i looking for?
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	that the md5 matches for the iso
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	lostmonk	dunno how
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	nero has that option too... pretty sure of that
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	i have done it, but since i have used k3b for the past year, i have forgotten windows junk ...hehe
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	kergan	ya me too
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	k3b is the kde cdburning app
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	tuggy1	heheI opened all off the standard ubuntu apps that are installed normally
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	calamari, if you mod the hdparm, first do the dma option then if it is stable, try something more daring
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	lostmonk	i have old nero soo
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	kergan	with minimal kde crap installed
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	yea
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	tuggy1	only using 381mb of ram
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	mroth	hmm.. im using 700mb running only xchat, thunderbird, firefox, gaim, and some terminal windows
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	tuggy1	wow mroth... youve got to be kidding
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lostmonk, look here
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	http://www.fastsum.com/press/md5-hash.php
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	mroth	according to resource monitor anyhow
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	ChrisC_	OK, next n00b question:  when I do some action requiring root, what governs whether I get a password prompt for that action?  It seems to be remembering the root password sometimes (i.e. no PW prompt)
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	tuggy1	are you compiling in the background?
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	that should get you going on a windows burn
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mroth	what are your stats coming from/
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mroth	nope
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	and free
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	tuggy1	from gnomes system monitor
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mroth	maybe it uses more because I have more total
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mroth	(2gb installed)
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	ChrisC_, if you su to root, then you just need the password when suing, then you are root.  if you use sudo then it remembers it and sometimes it just doesn't require a password (at least it can be set up that way)
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	tuggy1	yeah I only have a gig installed
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	mroth	firefox has a VM size of 120MB :/
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	mroth	haha wtf trashapplet has a vm size of 27.3mb
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	CheatersRealm, ChrisC_ also note the option to open a root terminal
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	tuggy1	how many tasks running?
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	which requires only entering sudo password once
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	tuggy1	I have 143
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	adbak	ChrisC_: or you can always use the root terminal: Applications -> Sys Tools -> Root Termina
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	mroth	why on earth does an icon of a trashcan need 30 megs of ram
2005-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	ChrisC_	let me do a test to see if I can come up with a testcase to illustrate what I mean ...
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	kergan	i have 150 running and still only takeing  2/3 of my ram
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	mroth	90 tasks total
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	I am really considering running ubuntu
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	tuggy1	yeah my trash take 24mb
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	tuggy1	kergan how much ram?
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	kergan	516
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	CheatersRealm, Ubuntu rocks
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	tuggy1	I have every gnome game launched right now :)
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	ChrisC_	adbak: actually, that's what's driving my question:  why don't I get a root PW prompt when I try to open a root terminal (it just opens)?
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	nomasteryoda, I figured I might get that response here :)
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	cryptomatt	i get this error right at the boot process saying that VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hda6.
2005-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	tuggy1	chris there is no root
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	it uses gksudo
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	cryptomatt	this is because its an reiserfs
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	cryptomatt: do you even use ext3?
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	tuggy1	so it asks for your password
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	cryptomatt	no i dont
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	well there you go ;)
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	ChrisC_	tuggy1: I know :) so what do you want to call the root terminal :)
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	cryptomatt	how can i prevent it from trying to read a ext3
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	ChrisC_, if you used sudo within 5 min then it acutally keeps your status as "sudo"
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	cryptomatt	i mean it just slows up my boot
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	lostmonk	nomasteryoda, how do i use that?
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	the checker?
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	ChrisC_	nomasteryoda: aha!  first prize!
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	cryptomatt	burber: ??
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	lostmonk	yeah
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	thanks
2005-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	what is ubuntu's package management system's name?
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	tuggy1	umm it should be called the sudo terminal
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	apt
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	CheatersRealm: synaptic?
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	adbak	CheatersRealm: apt
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	ChrisC_	nomasteryoda: is that configured somewhere?
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	aight, thx
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	tuggy1	but it is in full root use mode
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	adbak	CheatersRealm: APT - Advanced Package Management
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	cryptomatt	VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hda6.
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	cryptomatt	VFS: Can't find ext2 filesystem on dev hda6.
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	tuggy1	am I the only one here that has a root file manager?
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	cryptomatt	it tries ext3, then it tries ext2 then settles for reiserfs
2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	cryptomatt	how can i make sure it just tries reiserfs upfront
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	the sudo timeout?
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	tuggy1	crypt, they talked about this on the forums
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	tuggy1	search there
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lostmonk, just download and install the program on windows ...
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	adbak, I know what APT is, maybe not what it stands for, but over the past few years, I've learned the power of the google
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	then check the iso md5sum
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	with it
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	:)
2005-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	cryptomatt	tuggy1: i will try that
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	cryptomatt: if you find out... enlighten me ;)
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	adbak	CheatersRealm: don't forget http://www.apt-get.org
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	ChrisC_	OK, next question, this one's a bit tougher and longer to ask ...
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	i'm curious as well
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bur[n] er, about?
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	ChrisC_	I want to just test out the 3D performance of my new machine (my first one wiht any kind of 3D hardware) ...
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	nomasteryoda: about the ext3 vfs error on boot when using reiser
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	ChrisC_	I downloaded the doom3-demo but it won't run ...
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	ChrisC_, what kind of card, memory, etc
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	nvidia is generally the best out there
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	tuggy1	chris have you tried glxgears
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	ChrisC_, can you run glxgears?
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	ChrisC_	I installed the nvidia drivers and it goes to X but then falls to a lower resolution version of my desktop with mouse frozen in upper left corner; Ctrl-Alt-Backspace recovers
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	i have 256mb and it runs well
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	tuggy1	to make sure you got 3d
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	cryptomatt	burner: i think it has to do with the boot image.. i think this particular boot image assumes a ext based FS.. settles for reiserfs eventually.. perhaps kernel will need to b recompiled?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	ChrisC_	glxgears:  glad to, synaptic?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	nope
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	just type it into a term
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	ChrisC_	running now!
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	what's it's fps?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	how many fps?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	if it bumped back to lower res, then nvidia is not running... you get a splashscreen for nvidia then the login
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	haha tuggy1
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	tuggy1	lol
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	ChrisC_	where does it display the fps
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	I think back in the terminal
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	tuggy1	in the term window
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	tuggy1	damn
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	nu-unxsaintaant_	hey
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	ChrisC_	oh, yeah ... 1300 fps
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	ChrisC_, some of the screensavers are GL, so they can also display fps
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	ChrisC_	2000
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	tuggy1	thats not bad
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	ok, does ubuntu have redhat-like config scripts for the services like apache?
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	ChrisC_	MSI FX5700LE
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	tuggy1	so 3d works for ya
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	tuggy1	umm what does doom 3 do when you run it?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	ChrisC_	tuggy1: agreed :)
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	ChrisC_, have you tried bzflag?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	nu-unxsaint	anybody know anything about Synaptic's repositories?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	CheatersRealm: rcconf ?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	also 3d
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	nu-unxsaint: yes
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	ChrisC_	It goes to a graphical startup screen, but after a few seconds bails out to the hosed screen I described above
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	ChrisC_	lemmee try it again
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	bur[n] er_, ok, that's part of it, will I have to edit the config scripts manually if I want apache to run a certain way?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	ChrisC_, make sure dvi and glx are in the XF86Config file
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	ChrisC_	oh wait, I can't, it'll kill this session ...
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lol
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	CheatersRealm: how do you want it to run?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	three key smash!
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	/etc/apache/httpd.conf ?
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	ChrisC_	nomasteryoda: OK, I'll look ...
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	ChrisC_, turn on the logging in xchat so you can save the sessions
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	bur[n] er_, right, so there's no systemwide configuration utilities? (i've used gentoo so I know how to do it, and I also have used fedora which does it all bascaily for you)
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	very handy sometimes
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	CheatersRealm: does what?
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	ChrisC_	nomasteryoda: I'm actually using Chatzilla, I'll evolve to a better IRC client some day :)
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lol

2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	fjordlander	Ubuntu does not seem to like something on my P4.   Downloaded and burned and can install on a P3 but installer hangs just as it displays the prompt to select the language for install on my P4.  No keyboard response. Ideas?  Can't switch to another console to view output even when i set debug options for boot.
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	AcidPils	is your keyboard broken?
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	AcidPils	;)

2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	craz_out	hrm, i'm installing ubuntu on a mates computer, and it keeps freezing on "load hotplug system" or something like that..
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	craz_out	anyone know what's up with that?
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	lostmonk	hehe
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	lostmonk	i just had it freeze on me in 4 spots, with 4 different burns of the cd
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	craz_out	i can't seem to get around it...  recovery mode still does it, and init=/bin/sh doen't work cause it's a usb kb
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	lostmonk	im moving on
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	lostmonk	seems i just cant install it myself
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	fjordlander	Hmm... I am freezing with a ps2 keyboard on a P4 Mobo with radeon card at choose language for installer stage
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	Zotnix	crazney, have you looked at dmesg?
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	craz_out	Zotnix, nah
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	craz_out	Zotnix, can i login at that stage?
2005-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	Zotnix	Well, you can look at it once you log in.
2005-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	fjordlander	I have set installer to full debugging but since it freezes at the the point it has just initiated framebuffer, I can't see debugging data
2005-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	craz_out	but it's freezing during init..
2005-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	Zotnix	Ah, ew
2005-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	fjordlander	Installs fine on a P3.  Also I know stock debian will install without this issue
2005-01-01T09:18:00.000Z	craz_laptop	over here now
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	Zotnix	craz_laptop, so you can
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	Zotnix	ack
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	Zotnix	so you can't boot up at all?
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	craz_laptop	well it freezes on 'starting hotplug subsystem'
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	craz_laptop	i can't swithc virtual terminals
2005-01-01T09:21:00.000Z	craz_laptop	at that stage
2005-01-01T09:22:00.000Z	Zotnix	Does it time out or it never goes on?
2005-01-01T09:22:00.000Z	craz_laptop	never goes on, it seems
2005-01-01T09:22:00.000Z	RuffianSoldier	ha
2005-01-01T09:24:00.000Z	craz_laptop	Zotnix, any idea how to get around it?
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	Zotnix	craz_laptop, did some googling. Not really sure.
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	craz_laptop	hrm, just tried some random boot cd my mate had lying around, it froze on the hotplug stuff too
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	sid77	hi
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	Zotnix	What kind of hardware do you have on there?
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	craz_laptop	Zotnix, hrm, xp3000+, usb kb/mouse.. standard other stuff
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	Zotnix	Which live CD do you have burned?
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	adnans	hmm, Xorg feels a lot slower after the recent updates :/
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	craz_laptop	slax i think
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	craz_laptop	and it's a shuttle pc
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	Zotnix	I meant the Ubuntu
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	Zotnix	warty-i386.iso ?
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	craz_laptop	oh
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	Zotnix	Or something like that?
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	craz_laptop	4.10
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	craz_laptop	i can't find a hoary cd, is that right?
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	Zotnix	warty-release-install-i386.iso
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	Zotnix	Did you get that one?
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	craz_laptop	he thinks so
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	Aoi	I have 3 lan cards, eth0 eth1 (network) are sis and eth2 (internet) via. I had setup only eth2, how can I bring up eth0 and eth1? (I would like to setup a gateway using firestarter and I failed ifconfig)
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	Zotnix	Which is a 64 bit processor... I THINK (if it doesn't work don't kill me) you need to get the amd64 release
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	craz_laptop	nah, it's not a 64bit cpu
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	craz_laptop	ahha!
2005-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	craz_laptop	usb keyboard it was
2005-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	Zotnix	Oh

2005-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	Zotnix	XP3000 isn't 64 bit?
2005-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	craz_laptop	nah

2005-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	craz_laptop	yeah either
2005-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	craz_laptop	once i finalise the setup nstuff i can get a dmesg output for you, if you like.
2005-01-01T09:36:00.000Z	craz_laptop	hrm, ok another problem.. nforce 2 network drivers, they don't ship do they?

2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	alka_trash	it's killing me, penguin all over the place
2005-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	alka_trash	Linspire is like a commercial version of Ubuntu with KDE, I like how there logo are these cheesy people running, it's like bottle of vitamins
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	alka_trash	it's always funny on how they rename sh!t to there own too
2005-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	alka_trash	I bet some kid is going to get this for Christmas and feel like I felt back in 83' when I got a intelevision instead of a Atari 2600.

2005-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	zenlunatic	does ubuntu powerpc have wireless support?
2005-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	xskoulax	zenlunatic, i think it has support for the airport cards but not airport extreme
2005-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	xskoulax	and i would imagine it supports pcmcia cards that it supports under x86
2005-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	xskoulax	but don't quote me on that ;)
2005-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	zenlunatic	cool i think i found a good distro
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	xskoulax	can't speak about it on ppc hardware yet
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	xskoulax	at least until i steal my brothers new iBook on xmas day ;p
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	zenlunatic	yeah well debian requires the 3rd iso for wireless-tools
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	xskoulax	but its been on my viao laptop for 2+ months now
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	xskoulax	which is the longest a linux distro has stayed on here
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	martin_	these faqs are frustrating
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	martin_	GOD
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	martin_	they dont explain anything
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	xskoulax	zenlunatic, it will be easier to install with a wired net hookup
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	xskoulax	but i did install with out
2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	martin_	people how do i switch to console mode from like uhm animated mode?
2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	martin_	like using commands
2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	martin_	and not your cursor and such things.. . .
2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	xskoulax	today is my first time back on #ubuntu since like the end of october i think, so i'm a little out of the loop
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	xskoulax	but the box has been running smooth in the intervening period, updates have worked good
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	xskoulax	i did manage to somehow lose my wep key week and a half ago though
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	xskoulax	but i'm certain that was me
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	martin_	xskoulax: can yo usee this?
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	xskoulax	yea
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	martin_	oh i thought people cant see my messages
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	xskoulax	sup martin_
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	martin_	everyone seems to ignore me for some reason
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	martin_	*sigh*
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	martin_	could you help me out a lil?
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	xskoulax	i'll try
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	xskoulax	but i'ma n00b
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	xskoulax	i might know what you need though
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	martin_	do you know how to switch to console mode?
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	martin_	you know, like windows has dos
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	martin_	this has some other thing
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	xskoulax	you can click on applications > system tools > terminal
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	xskoulax	that would bring up a "dos box"
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	xskoulax	in windows terms
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	martin_	cool
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	martin_	and i can use that to do whatever i like?
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	martin_	i mean, it has effect?
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	xskoulax	ctrl+alt+f1-f6 will also bring up command line and you would use ctrl+alt+f7 to get back to the Graphical interface
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	xskoulax	well martin_ you can do anything a normal user can
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	xskoulax	to do root stuff in ubuntu you use sudo
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	martin_	what is root stuff?
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	xskoulax	more detail on sudo is where i would be starting to get out of my depth
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	xskoulax	root is the admin account on linux
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	martin_	ok, and sudo?
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	xskoulax	sudo is a way of accessing root account commands from your account
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	martin_	alright... umm
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	xskoulax	most linux's force you to have a root and a normal account
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	martin_	whats the best way to learn about this system?
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	martin_	this is my first tiem with linux... took me an entire day just to install it.. i had lots of weird problems
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	martin_	playing with the terminal?
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	xskoulax	martin_, stick with it; when you get things working you get a nice warm fuzzy feeling ;)
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	martin_	yeah im sticking with it, i like this much more than windows
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	xskoulax	terminal would be the dos equilivent
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	xskoulax	www.linuxquestions.org is a good forum for general linux stuff i've found
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	martin_	skoul
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	martin_	ah cool
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	martin_	say, how do i get windows to boot whenever i like and ubuntu to boot whenever i like without windows taking over?
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	massi	ciao!
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	xskoulax	martin_, you need to install windows before installing ubuntu
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	massi	hi ^^
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	martin_	i thoght so
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	xskoulax	otherwise it will overwrite the area ubuntu needs to boot
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	martin_	hi massi :)
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	martin_	man
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	martin_	windows is a bitch
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	xskoulax	ubuntu and linux in general isn't as arrogant :p
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	martin_	so tell me please, how do i set things?
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	xskoulax	set things?
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	martin_	i mean
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	martin_	lets say i format
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	martin_	and install windows... and then i go and install ubuntu
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	martin_	then i can decide how to devide the partitions?
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	martin_	without ruining the windows installation?
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	massi	well..i'm trying to use a picodisk (usb mass storage)..i've done mount /dev/sda .. but into /dev/ i haven't /sda .. what can i do ?_?
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	martin_	sorry massi thats like chinese to me :/
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	martin_	i still havent figured out how to listen to music -_-
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	massi	martin_, ^_^ understood
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	xskoulax	martin_, the best solution if you can is to use another computer for learning linux that way you can't hose you windows install
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	xskoulax	if thats not possiable i'd prefer to use 2 seperate harddrives to keep things seperated
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	martin_	skoulax, dont have another computer :/
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	xskoulax	thought that might be the case
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	martin_	thats a pretty good idea.. i wonder where i could get another hard drive though, im short on cash
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	ctd	Unless it's essential, usually the best way is to just go straight linux and boot off windows.
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	ctd	That way you force yourself to learn.
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	xskoulax	there is less risk of messing up important work with stuff on seperate hard drives
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	xskoulax	ctd has a very good point
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	martin_	yes, ctd does ^^
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	xskoulax	i guess it depends on what you need your computer for
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	martin_	well finally i found some people who answer my questions
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	martin_	i was getting really frustrated
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	xskoulax	if your are a gamer going pure linux could get frustrating fast
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	martin_	oh... cause i am
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	martin_	although i havent been gaming in the past week at all
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	xskoulax	but if you need a stable computer for email word processing and internet you really can't go wrong with linux
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	martin_	i could stop quake3ing for a while i suppose :)
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	xskoulax	quake3 works on linux
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	xskoulax	\o/

2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	martin_	i dont understand jack shit about all these packages
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	xskoulax	i've got it working on the slackware install i did for my brother waaaay back
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	martin_	i dont even know what a package is
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	xskoulax	package is like a zipped program kinda
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	xskoulax	except in ubuntu and indeed other debian distributions you have a nice program called apt-get
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	xskoulax	it downloads the program and anything else it needs to run
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	xskoulax	and will install it too
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	martin_	where can i get it?

2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	martin_	how do i run it then
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	subterrific	martin_: use synaptic, it is a gui front-end for apt-get
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	martin_	?

2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	karlos	?

2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Agrajag	gedit should be easier to use
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Agrajag	there should be instruction in that file on enabling "universe"
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	martin_	alright.. whats universe?
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	xskoulax	martin_, if you type alt+f2 you can get a run box

2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	martin_	the first ## is : Uncomment the following two lines to fetch updated software from the network
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	xskoulax	becomes deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	martin_	the second ## is: Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Agrajag	you see the two lines, right after that one that sayas "the next two lines"?
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Agrajag	those two
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	martin_	the universe lines?
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Agrajag	they have a URL in them, and at the very end they say "universe"
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Agrajag	remove the # from the front of those lines
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	martin_	and i leave the the 'fetch software from the network' alone?
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Agrajag	yes
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	xskoulax	martin_, it might help to maximize the editor
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	martin_	yeah, ive maximized it :)
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	xskoulax	so wordwrap isn't confusing the issue
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	martin_	ok ive removed the comments
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	ok

2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	xskoulax	yea
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	martin_	184kb/sec, sweet
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	xskoulax	that line is actually 2 commands
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	martin_	yeah i understood that && means "and"
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	xskoulax	yea
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	martin_	and & does nothing?
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	xskoulax	Agrajag, ?
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	Agrajag	&& means that when the first command completes successfully, run the second.
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	If the first command fail, do not run the second.
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	filas
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	FAILS
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	martin_	Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	martin_	bah?
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	xskoulax	& does nothing correct
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	man my fingers must be retarded
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	martin_	er i need to rewrite the error it gave me
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	xskoulax: yes it does
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	martin_	hold on this might take some time.
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Agrajag	& by itself runs a command in the background, rather than the foreground
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	xskoulax	ok koo thats what i thought
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	martin_	some packages could not be isntalled. this may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are usding the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of incoming.
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	Agrajag	that's... odd.
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	Agrajag	back in a moment.
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	martin_	theres another thing, sec
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	xskoulax	martin_, i'm guessin he's checking something
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	martin_	since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that the package is simply not installable and a bug report against taht package should be filed. the following information may helpo to solve the situtation:
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	martin_	xskoulax, alright. btw, how do you type my name? you actually type it, or is there a hotkey or something
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	xskoulax	i type mar then hit the tab key and it finishes it for me :D
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	xskoulax	you could use xs tab for me
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	xskoulax	i would imagine
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	martin_	the following packages have unmet dependencies: bittornado-gui:depends:libwxgtk2.4-python but it is not going to be installed
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	martin_	oh cool
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	martin_	i didnt know you could do that here
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	xskoulax	that means bittornado needs a python libary
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	xskoulax	which would be a dll in windows
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	xskoulax	at least thats my understanding
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	martin_	i dont even know what ddl files are for
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	martin_	is there a hotkey to maximize/minimized windows?
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	xskoulax	dlls are like small chunks of program that can be use by lots of programs
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	xskoulax	but if you are missing the dll your program is like wait a second i have a peice missing
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	xskoulax	and crashes :D
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	xskoulax	alt+f5 alt+f9 its seems
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	martin_	oh ok :)
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	Agrajag	figure it out yet martin_ ?
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	xskoulax	i'm guessing you're using xchat for irc, if you click on the X icon it will show the short cuts on the menu
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	martin_	Agrajag, nope
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	xskoulax	<martin_> the following packages have unmet dependencies: bittornado-gui:depends:libwxgtk2.4-python but it is not going to be installed
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	martin_	xskoulax, yes i am
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	zenkov	hm :-(
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	martin_	xskoulax, which x icon, top left?
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	xskoulax	yea
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	xskoulax	sorry i meant the program icon not close :p
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	martin_	xskoulax, i didnt close :)
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	xskoulax	i know, but that was poor guiding on my part :)
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	zenkov	My problem is that I dont have a /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd entry. In /dev I have entries for my disks, for my audio devices, for my input devices and also for my floppy device but no entry for my cdroms. How i can fix it?
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	martin_	how come alt+f8 doesnt do anything?
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	martin_	it should resize
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	xskoulax	dunno
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	xskoulax	i,ve never used those short cuts before
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	xskoulax	you have to click near the edge i think with that
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	martin_	oh, its done with the arrows
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	alexissoft	hi

2005-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	Agrajag	hm
2005-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	xskoulax	zenkov, i think you would have to add the stuff for your cdroms manually
2005-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	Agrajag	what about: sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.4-python
2005-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	xskoulax	nm i misread that
2005-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	Agrajag	then: sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui
2005-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	martin_	working on it..
2005-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	xskoulax	its not seeing the actual devices, are they burners zenkov
2005-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	martin_	Agrajag, i ran it through f2 but it didnt do anything
2005-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	martin_	oh i didnt click run in terminal :)

2005-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	xskoulax	applications > system tools > terminal if you forgot where it is
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	martin_	Agrajag, after running sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.4-python it gave me the same error
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	martin_	as the first time

2005-01-01T12:44:00.000Z	jordi	siretart: he means a tiny CD image.
2005-01-01T12:46:00.000Z	Pozac	I thought there was a tiny CD image.

2005-01-01T01:01:00.000Z	siretart	jordi: I dont find it right now, but I used to have a tiny cd netinst image (about 4mb iso image) for warty
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	demon666_nl	I meant installing without a CD
2005-01-01T01:02:00.000Z	demon666_nl	I mean a floppy image
2005-01-01T01:03:00.000Z	|Snegec|	how exactly do you set up a dsl connection once ubuntu is installed?
2005-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	pisuke	hi. anyone knows if ubuntu cvs binary has http proxy support? how can I enable it?
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	Zomb	can anyone paste the sources.list line for the current ubuntu unstable branch?
2005-01-01T01:17:00.000Z	pisuke	Zomb, just s/warty/horay
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	sid77	hi
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Zomb	pisuke: s,debian,ubuntu, -> no "just", dude
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Zomb	the doc search system on the homepage sucks. Does not find "sources.list".
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	demon666_nl	Will there be a floppy netinstall image for ubuntu ?
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	frogbert	Can someone tell me how to mount another ext3 partition so that any user can read/write to it?
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	davybondo	Hi my 1st time on irc
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	housetier	hello davybondo
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	housetier	welcome to the harsh and addictive world of irc
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	jordi	davybondo: welcome to the productivity blackhole.
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	housetier	HAHAHAHAa
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	jordi	heh
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	davybondo	Hi housetier and all you guys
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	davybondo	can I ask 1 of you a question about Ubuntu
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	davybondo	this is my 1st time useing Ubuntu ....I was useing Mandrake
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	vegai	I wonder if the ubuntu team is considering a default firewall setup?
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Zomb	frogbert: ext3 is not stupid fat. It knows permission flags, so do not try to cheat the kernel.
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	housetier	davybondo ask your question here and it will most likely be answered
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	vegai	frogbert: easy ;) mount /dev/hda8 /mnt ; chmod -R a+rwx /mnt/*
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	vegai	but that's probably not what you wanted..
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	davybondo	I'm trying to access my hdc drive but it's disabled anybody know how I can access it......Thanks
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pozac	disabled?
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	davybondo	I have XP on the hdc drive and Ubuntu on my slave drive hdd
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pozac	frogbert, can't you just set low permissions on it?
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Pozac	davybondo, have you selected the correct partition?
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Pozac	hdc1 or whatever
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	davybondo	ya tried both ...they have a red icon on them
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	ar|k	what is ubuntu all abt. its spreadin like fire
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	bob2	www.ubuntulinux.org, it's the coolest linux distribution in town!
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	Pozac	ar|k, ubuntu means humanity towards others ;)
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	ar|k	is it better than mepis/.
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	davybondo	says I dont have permission it wont let me log on as root
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	Pozac	davybondo, what does mount -t ntfs /dev/hdc1 /mnt/windows say?
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	bob2	mepis is a livecd
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	bob2	ubuntu is an operating system
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	ar|k	simple installation?
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	frogbert	Okay so will that say that way when I reboot?
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	Pozac	davybondo, are you aware of the way root is handled in ubuntu?
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	davybondo	I'll try that Pozac ...should I type into a terminal window
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	cef	bob2: you know what I need? a livecd with dev tools and distcc.. *grin*
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	bob2	cef: haha
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	cef	bob2: for all those work machines that sit idle every night
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pozac	davybondo, yeah.. if you need to be root, use 'sudo -s' first
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pozac	cef, like the gentoo one? :)
2005-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	ar|k	im new to linux. im thinking of installing mandrake10.1 cos they say this is the easiest. pls tell me what ubuntu can offer... plss
2005-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	cef	Pozac: yeah, but all ubuntu.. none of that silly gentoo over-optimization
2005-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	bob2	ar|k: if you don't know anything about linux, then about the only thing that matters is ease of installation.  I'm pretty sure ubuntu's is simpler than mandrake's.
2005-01-01T01:41:00.000Z	Pozac	cef ;)
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	Pozac	ubuntu install is so easy
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	ar|k	what abt other installations?
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	Pozac	try them
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	bob2	ar|k: you'd have to ask them
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	Pozac	they are free
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	Pozac	:)
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	bob2	e.g., #mandrake or whatever
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	Pozac	I highly recommend Ubuntu for everyone.
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	bob2	me too
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	ar|k	thanks
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	Pozac	davybondo, did you add anything to your /etc/fstab file?
2005-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	davybondo	tried it Pozac typed in -t ntfs /dev/hdc1 /mnt/windows and came back with               command not found, I know it is a ntfs file system
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	bob2	you forgot the word 'mount'
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	Pozac	davybondo, mount :)
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	davybondo	no never heard of that
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	bob2	"sudo mount  -t ntfs /dev/hdc1 /mnt/windows"
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	Pozac	if /mnt/windows is where you want it
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	Pozac	Isn't this documented somewhere?
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	bob2	yes

2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	bob2	atropus: kill whatever is making it busy

2005-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	vegai	I wonder if the ubuntu team is considering a default firewall setup?

2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	demon666_nl	bob2 : I can't find anything about it on the wiki. (only howto's if you've installed linux already or use knoppix or debian bootfloppy's)
2005-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	usual	vegai, I am using firestarter
2005-01-01T02:03:00.000Z	usual	vegai, it's nice

2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, have you made a firefox icon yet?
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	AndyFit1	now I know why people wear those _Insert name_ broke my gnome   t-shirts
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	vegai: there are lots, but none of them were considered 'best of breed' enough to go in
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	bob2	vegai: also, the default install has no need for a firewall
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	usual	hehe
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	vegai	demon666_nl: but aren't daemons automatically started in Debian/Ubuntu?

2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, did you move the file or something?
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	AndyFit1	you'll basically  get what debian has

2005-01-01T02:25:00.000Z	etorix	so dialogs are un-accessible

2005-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	wood1	I miss you guys and dolls
2005-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	AndyFit1	and welcome back
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, I see a bunch or templates but nowhere to custom tell it to do 128x128
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual CTRL+SHIFT+D
2005-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	AndyFit1	just open the document properties dialog
2005-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	demon666_nl	vegai : all ports are closed by default and only opened when you install something like apache. But firestarter might be nice if you want to make sure those services aren't reachable. A firewall is also nice if you're paranoid :)
2005-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	AndyFit1	totem-xine and mplayer arent opening my divx :P
2005-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	demon666_nl	bob2 : thnx
2005-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	wood1	How do I transfer a file from Amsn to somebody from Gaim ?
2005-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, do I have to do something special to perfectly paste the icon into the new doc? or do I just drag it over it and hope for the best
2005-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	AndyFit1	I wanna watch theOCS02E06.  too bad I guess lol
2005-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, did you install the multimedia packages like libdvdcss2 or whatever
2005-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual, those bugs were fixed when I visited the inkscape dev team in melbourne :)
2005-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	AndyFit1	it should work fine.  but ungrouping everything and pressing up down helps too.. also making sure you vacuum the defs every so often
2005-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	zenlunatic	how does one verify the iso is not corrupted? ie md5?
2005-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	zenlunatic	or does ubuntu not have this?
2005-01-01T02:33:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual: yeah I installed everything needed.  and I didnt uninstall anything .  the same files that played a few days ago won't play now  with no corruption etc
2005-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual,  could you pm me you sources.list  ?
2005-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, sure
2005-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	AndyFit1	you= your
2005-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	AndyFit1	thanks .  I did alot of sources.list cleansing when gnome-panel didnt load ;)
2005-01-01T02:35:00.000Z	etorix	hmm .. why didnt i get an option to set a root password and account
2005-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	etorix	how am i i sposed to edit
2005-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1, 1 sec
2005-01-01T02:36:00.000Z	AndyFit1	etorix, because it uses sudo
2005-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	AndyFit1	now you type sudo -s  instead of su
2005-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	etorix	the user is in the sudoers?
2005-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	AndyFit1	if you want more than the first user to be able to use sudo  you have to edit sudoers
2005-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	etorix	ah ok
2005-01-01T02:37:00.000Z	etorix	no second user

2005-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	etorix	i used fedora for a day or so
2005-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gsuveg: it worked the first time
2005-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	gsuveg	da_bon_bon: test with ubuntu :)
2005-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	AcidPils	cant you change to a console? maybe with some more input would help
2005-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gsuveg: i have alreadytried ubuntu and like it
2005-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	AcidPils	why fedora then? oO
2005-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	gsuveg	yes. why ?
2005-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	AcidPils: to get the feel of it. also, i LOVE kde
2005-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	AcidPils	kde is great... as long as i dont have to use it
2005-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	gsuveg	da_bon_bon: then apt-get install kde or so
2005-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	Kamion	zenlunatic: in the installer, go back to the main menu and look for "verify the CD-ROM's integrity" near the bottom
2005-01-01T02:55:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gsuveg: ok. but i still wanana try FC3
2005-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	gsuveg	da_bon_bon: intall vmware ;)
2005-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	etorix	fc3 = no apt
2005-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gsuveg: i was thinking of that!!
2005-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	gsuveg	etorix: nono. you can use apt in fc
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	Ileden	Hi! I'm quite new to linux (haven't gotten it to work well enough for me yet), and I'll probably be installing Ubuntu next time I'll try it out. I'm wondering if this channel is friendly towards help requests concerning ubuntu, and linux in general - can I get help here during the setup process?
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	zeedo	Ileden: yep
2005-01-01T03:15:00.000Z	Ileden	Great. :)
2005-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	zeedo	as long as you have read the docs first, people here will be happy to help
2005-01-01T03:16:00.000Z	AcidPils	im also new to this chan, but most of the guys here are helful
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	Ileden	Well, I'll be sure to try the docs first, but not everything is that well documented, at least for those with not much previous technical experience with linux...
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	Ileden	I haven't yet read the ubuntu docs, though.
2005-01-01T03:17:00.000Z	|rufius|	Could anyone tell me how to change my default media player from Totem to something else?
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	siretart	ah, hi AcidPils ;)
2005-01-01T03:18:00.000Z	Ileden	I'd also like to know whether this channel has a friendly attitude towards helping out on setting up technically insignificant, but usability-wise meaningful features for ubuntu? Often some of my questions and laments about some aspects of linux have been met with somewhat of a resistance from people using linux, which does make setting up a linux for my tastes a problem.
2005-01-01T03:19:00.000Z	siretart	Ileden: I have a good impression of the ubuntu community. Both in this channel and in the wiki
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	siretart	Ileden: but you'll never learn if you don't try ;)
2005-01-01T03:20:00.000Z	Ileden	siretart: From what small I've seen at the wiki, I also got a good impression. One of the reasons ubuntu seems so appealing. :)
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	Ileden	siretart: So true. The main problem is just that - you (or at least I) mostly learn by doing. But I need to have the system up and working for me to start learning how it works. And from previous experience it seems to set up linux (not just install) you need to know how it works. So there we have an endless loop. :)
2005-01-01T03:23:00.000Z	Ileden	by setting up I don't just mean the installation.
2005-01-01T03:24:00.000Z	Ileden	I mean installing and setting up all the software required for normal use of a computer system -.which is somewhat extensive list for me :)
2005-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	siretart	Ileden: ubuntu works fairly good at setting up a gnome desktop with office tools like openoffice and evolution. it depends how YOU want to use your computer. for many people this suffices
2005-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	etorix	best way to learn is by doing
2005-01-01T03:25:00.000Z	|rufius|	hrm i just want to get rid of totem... stupid totem
2005-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	AcidPils	hi siretart i found my way to this channel at last ;)
2005-01-01T03:26:00.000Z	siretart	hehe
2005-01-01T03:28:00.000Z	Ileden	siretart: yes, that is the problem, for most people Office is enough. I however have some more uses, and on previous occasion I haven't gotten all of the applications I want to work.
2005-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	Ileden	and most people that have more uses already know how to use linux. :)
2005-01-01T03:29:00.000Z	siretart	Ileden: what applications are you talking of?
2005-01-01T03:30:00.000Z	Ileden	well, last time I tried (Mandrake) I couldn't get grip to copy CDs properly, nor could I understand how the cd writing software was meant to be used. To name two examples.
2005-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	siretart	grip is not a burning application, but a fairly good ripper
2005-01-01T03:32:00.000Z	Ileden	oh, sorry, I wasn't using grip for trying to burn something.
2005-01-01T03:33:00.000Z	Ileden	I don't remember what I used anymore, it was more than a year ago, or something. :)
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	Ileden	there were other problems as well, but I'm afraid I don't recall all of them either. :)
2005-01-01T03:34:00.000Z	Ileden	I have tried to map out my uses for my computer though, to approach moving to linux at least in a somewhat organized fashion.
2005-01-01T03:36:00.000Z	Ileden	But anyway, I'll probably won't have time for my next attempt at linux until next year, so this I'm just here to check out whether the Ubuntu community is nice and friendly enough to help me. :)

2005-01-01T03:37:00.000Z	rhodan	hello thar

2005-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	wood1	Treenaks, are you there ?
2005-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	wood1	AndyFit, do you know how to install fonts in Ubuntu ?
2005-01-01T03:38:00.000Z	wood1	I want to install some ttf fonts
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	AndyFit1	wood1: yeah there are a few ways..    the easiest is to go to fonts:// in nautilus and drag and drop them
2005-01-01T03:39:00.000Z	AndyFit1	open nautilus  go  CTRL+L  type fonts://  and drag the ttf files in there
2005-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	wood1	fonts://
2005-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	wood1	that's it

2005-01-01T03:40:00.000Z	srbaker	i need at least those appas
2005-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	wood1	thanks Andy
2005-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	AndyFit1	nps
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	|rufius|	has anyone in here tried to play Postal for linux?
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	|rufius|	hrm actually, more accurately, has anyone tried to play a game and have it completely mess up the xserver?
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	AndyFit1	srbaker: f-spot is very unstable unless you get it from cvs
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	royalbuds	hi, whats the difference between debian and ubuntu?
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	|rufius|	royalbuds: ubuntu is more user friendly
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	srbaker	oh
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	srbaker	suck
2005-01-01T03:42:00.000Z	srbaker	what about tomboy packages?
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	|rufius|	like if i try to play netpanzer or postal, my xserver goes nuts and dies on me, have to restart it
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	royalbuds	|rufius|, but what about the packages, can i use debian mirrors?
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	AndyFit1	the rest should be in unstable or multiverse
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	AndyFit1	I mean universe
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	srbaker	uh, tomboy isn't
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	|rufius|	royalbuds: if you wanted to but i havent found much that the ubuntu mirrors didn'th ave...
2005-01-01T03:43:00.000Z	AndyFit1	srbaker ? hoary ?
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	royalbuds	|rufius|, but i can use apt?
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	srbaker	AndyFit1, no, warty
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	kensai	royalbuds, yep apt is the package manager for ubuntu too
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	AndyFit1	ahh sorry  yeah I know there is a repo for warty too.    getswea something something
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	linux_mafia	srbaker, tseng's repo has those things
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	|rufius|	royalbuds: its debian essentially, if it didn't have apt, you couldn't call it based on debian
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	|rufius|	;)
2005-01-01T03:44:00.000Z	srbaker	thx

2005-01-01T03:47:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wood1, mono app for taking notes
2005-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	srbaker	oh damn.  mono is only in universe
2005-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	srbaker	wood1, tomboy is a wiki for your desktop.  it kicks major ass
2005-01-01T03:48:00.000Z	wood1	What does it do actually ?

2005-01-01T03:49:00.000Z	mgedmin	apparently the CD-ROM drive is not detected on Dell PowerEdge 750 servers
2005-01-01T03:50:00.000Z	mgedmin	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-4062.html implies it is possible, but I cannot find network installation methods anywhere

2005-01-01T04:09:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Pozac, ahhh, imma have to look into that
2005-01-01T04:10:00.000Z	Pozac	Gwildor, it has some problems with memory though... it doesn't leave out the buffers/cache part, so memory seems to be full very quick :(
2005-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Java: tried the way of ubuntuguide, didnt work
2005-01-01T04:11:00.000Z	Blackwell	hi

2005-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	1.4.2
2005-01-01T04:13:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	1.5 does not work for me -_-
2005-01-01T04:14:00.000Z	Blackwell	DoktorTomoe: try better than "does not work"?
2005-01-01T04:14:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Blackwell: The custom banking account application written by that damn freelancer I have to use is not running under 1.5
2005-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	Blackwell	DoktorTomoe: ah, so java 1.5 is running fine on your box? who's next? :)
2005-01-01T04:15:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Java 1.5 used to run on that old SuSE-Box of mine. I tried it there. Ubuntu is pretty new on this system
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Blackwell: The Problem is how to install Java 1.4.2 on Ubuntu, because I am stuck with this java application (it refuses to run under 1.5)
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	Blackwell	DoktorTomoe: same way as 1.5 :)
2005-01-01T04:17:00.000Z	Blackwell	DoktorTomoe: http://javafaq.mine.nu/lookup?67
2005-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	Pozac	Are there any goodies in the linux-image-2.6.9-1 build that are not in 2.6.8.1 ?
2005-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Pozac, inotify
2005-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	Pozac	ohh
2005-01-01T04:18:00.000Z	Pozac	for gamin?
2005-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	etorix	is there a ppp-setup app?
2005-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Pozac, i guess, i only know of its use with beagle
2005-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	etorix	pppconfig gives me just errors
2005-01-01T04:20:00.000Z	etorix	/usr/sbin/pppconfig: line 24: BEGIN: command not found
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	etorix	ha ha ha
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	etorix	/usr/sbin/pppconfig: line 25: use: command not found
2005-01-01T04:21:00.000Z	Pozac	etorix, did you try System Settings -> Network ?
2005-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	etorix	ok ill try that
2005-01-01T04:22:00.000Z	etorix	.. i cant find any ppp stuff in the *install* manual
2005-01-01T04:23:00.000Z	Pozac	linux_mafia, I'm hoping inotify/gamin will solve alot of my FAM woes :)
2005-01-01T04:24:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Pozac, i dont think gamin really has anything to do with inotify, at the moment anyway, until dnotify is completely depreciated
2005-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	Pozac	linux_mafia, ok :(
2005-01-01T04:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	hm. good to see that it is not only java developers who get "deprecated" wrong all the time. ;)
2005-01-01T04:26:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell, its deprecation or what win32 has become :)
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Blackwell, hey your right, i guess i never thought about it, must be mis-spelled/mis-used so often
2005-01-01T04:29:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac: win32, deprecated? funk, nobody told me. i need to tell my boss, we need to cancel the current project. :)
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	Pozac	Blackwell, Its not. It should. :)
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	linux_mafia: i keep seeing it in the java realm. it's too funny, even the sharpest and most nitpicking java folks get it wrong now and then. ;)
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pozac: ah, perhaps, like any c level api :)
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	wood1	What is the difference between a .tar file and a .bz2 file format ?
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	but then again, someone's got to write the nice infrastructure for us high level bozos...:)
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Pozac	wood1, tar just packs file into one, no compression
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	rhodan	hello thar
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: one os file archive with compression, the other only an archive.
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	macewan	http://www.macewan.org/index.php?m=200412#post-200
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Pozac	wood1, bz2 and gz are ways to compress that single tar file
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	macewan	could someone look at that and tell me if it makes sense?
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	macewan	it's a tomboy howto install
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: actually, i take that bz2 being a file archive format back. it may be, don't know. :)
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	Pozac	macewan, compiling is not needed on ubuntu
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	Blackwell	macewan: install of vs. on?
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	tim1	macewan: there are tomboy .deb packages
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	macewan	really?
2005-01-01T04:32:00.000Z	tim1	in hoary ...
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	macewan	what about warty
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	Pozac	I got the package from somewhere when I ran warty
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	Pozac	tim1, you got mono working in hoary?
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	macewan: consider bold step marks or something, so that at first glance the steps can be told apart easily. oh, i know, i am nitpicking on form, not content. :-)
2005-01-01T04:33:00.000Z	tim1	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/tomboy/
2005-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	Kirsch	hey guys, i'm not new to linux but I have never needed to try and dialup before, can someone point me to a good howto or to where the config is so I can try and figure it out?
2005-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	macewan	no, thanks for the input
2005-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	macewan	:)
2005-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	tim1	Pozac: there are also .deb packages for mono :)
2005-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	rhodan	neep neep
2005-01-01T04:34:00.000Z	Pozac	tim1, I can't install it since it was removed a few days ago
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	Pozac	deb http://www.getsweaaa.com/~tseng/ubuntu/debs ./ <- to get tomboy, from http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	Pozac	in warty
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	Kirsch: got dsl?
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	tim1	yeah i can't update it to 1.0.4 either, but 1.0.2 is still working
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	macewan	well I'll be
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	Pozac	So how do I go about installing 1.0.2 ?
2005-01-01T04:35:00.000Z	linux_mafia	shit, last cig
2005-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	linux_mafia: smoking can cause death.
2005-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	rhodan	is it worth upgrading to hoary hedgehog ?
2005-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	tim1	apt-get install mono=1.0.2
2005-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	and cancer. and...
2005-01-01T04:36:00.000Z	macewan	in hoary it complains about not have *mint or something another not being version 1.0.4
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	rhodan	is hoaring hedgehog worth the upgrade ?
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	Kirsch	Blackwell: No, Dialup
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	Kirsch	old fashioned 56K
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	Kirsch	PPP
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	Pozac	tim1, version 1.0.2 not found..
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	tim1	hm
2005-01-01T04:37:00.000Z	Pozac	rhodan, it breaks but it's sweet. You decide. :)
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	linux_mafia	hoaring hedgehog, haha, (pictures a hedgehog out on a boozy stripclub night)
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	rhodan	kekeke
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	tim1	pozac: wait a second
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	wood1	can the "tar" command be used to unzip .zip files
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	rhodan	Pozac: what breaks ? anything major ?
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	Pozac	use unzip
2005-01-01T04:38:00.000Z	wood1	I can't extract a .bz2 file using tar ?
2005-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	Pozac	rhodan, ubuntu is released every 6 months, with feature additions in the beginning (=breakage, like X.Org was a few days ago), but later on it will stabilize
2005-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	macewan	bunzip2 *.bz2
2005-01-01T04:39:00.000Z	Pozac	wood1, tar vxjpf archive.tar.bz2
2005-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	linux_mafia	wood1, it all depends, a straight .bz2 you would use bzip2 -d <file> a tar.bz2 then tar jxf <filr>
2005-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	maswan	linux_mafia: Ehm. j means to do automatic bzip2 decompression. either bzip2 -d first or j as a flag to tar.
2005-01-01T04:40:00.000Z	Pozac	wood1, if you have got X, then file-roller is a sweet tool. :)
2005-01-01T04:41:00.000Z	tim1	pozac: i have the 1.0.2 packages still in my apt cache
2005-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	wood1	By the way, I can't connect to this IRC Channel using Port 6667
2005-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	Kirsch	How do I know where my modem is?
2005-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	linux_mafia	maswan, yeah i know, didnt make myself clear, a straight .bz2 you would use bzip2 -d <file> or if you have a tar.bz2 then tar jxf <file>, better?
2005-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	Kirsch	which /dev/ttySX ?
2005-01-01T04:42:00.000Z	Pozac	tim1, I'll just wait for some fixage :)
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	wood1	Could that be due to some firewall that I can't connect to this #IRC using gaim
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	Pozac	tim1, thanks :)
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	linux_mafia	maswan, or can you go tar j on a straight .bz2, is that what youre saying?
2005-01-01T04:43:00.000Z	tim1	pozac: ok :)
2005-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	wood1	linux_mafia, I think that my network administrator has block the port 6667
2005-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	wood1	How do I connect to gaim and still access port 6667
2005-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	pisuke	tar xvfz *.tar.gz or *.tgz
2005-01-01T04:44:00.000Z	pisuke	tar xvfj *.tar.bz2
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: ask your network admin. you don't want to get fired for hacking your way around a block set up esp. for you.
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	pisuke	that's it. or use fireroller :)
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	linux_mafia	using gaim for irc? odd, or is it common? ive used xchat or bitchx only
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	wood1	Well Blackwell, is there a way out ?
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	Blackwell	packer/unpacker support isn't integrated into the file explorer?
2005-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	maswan	linux_mafia: the first thing
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: a six-pack might do the trick.
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	wood1	Linux_mafia, which software are you using to chat in this forum right now ?
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	linux_mafia	xchat
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	wood1	I am using gaim
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: excellent, so your port 6667 is not blocked?
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	wood1	How many of you here use Gaim to access this chat forum ?
2005-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: this is irc. not a forum.
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	Aoi	hi ya, I can't figure out how to setup my home network. I would like ubuntu act as my internet gateway for another 2 boxes. I have eth0 internet (sis), eth1(sis) and eth2(via). witch ip I need to set on eth1?
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	Pozac	in a way, it's also a forum
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	Pozac	there were fora (?) before there phpBB and the internets
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	Blackwell	Aoi: consider a little broadband router. that is more secure since there is less room for screwing up the security related config. you can still have the ubuntu box behind that nat router.
2005-01-01T04:47:00.000Z	wood1	Blackwell, this is the only PC on my network which does not have the port 6667 blocked because it is used as a fax Server
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: yeah, i hear fax uses port 6667.
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	wood1	Pozax, I understand that this is not a forum
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	Blackwell	(kidding)
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	Aoi	Blacwell what do you think use a nat router and setup firestarter?
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi, Use a class C adress, like 192.168.1.1
2005-01-01T04:48:00.000Z	wood1	So is there a way out to access this chatroom from my other Network PCs?
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	rhodan	i'm trying to install mplayer following the FAQ off the ubuntu forum
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Blackwell	Aoi: i don't know what firestarter is. but i mean do not use a pc for the first line of defense. it is too easy to screw the security related configuration up.
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	wood1	I have installed Ubuntu on all of my network pcs
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac, how can I do it? eth1 192.0.0.1 and my windowz box 192.0.0.2 ? (crossed over)
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	rhodan	but when i run  $ sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Aoi	Blackwell, I see, firestarter is a iptables gui
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	rhodan	it says i need to specifically choose one to install
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	rhodan	any ideas
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi, you need the 192.168 part, but otherwise ok
2005-01-01T04:49:00.000Z	Aoi	I don't mind use ubuntu as the first line defense because it is dedicated
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	wood1	So Blackwell, is there a way to connect to this chatroom from my other PCs ?
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Blackwell	Aoi: these routers cost something like usd30, 40. really worth their money.
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Aoi, read a gateway or nat howto
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Kirsch	i know this may be a long shot, but i have an LG4500 (Verizon, USA) phone with a datacable, I know that in windows i was able to use it as a modem and dialup. Is there a way i can do this in Linux?
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Blackwell	Aoi: more points to get it wrong than right, with a full blown operating system, in my opinion. but that's just me perhaps.
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac, I can't figure out, ipconfig eth1 192.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 ? then I need to forward ipv4 ?
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	Pozac	I own a Linksys router. It's a 166mhz box that runs Linux :)
2005-01-01T04:50:00.000Z	wood1	Blackwell, how do you mean by a six-pack ????
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Blackwell	daisy chaining them works nicely :)
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, I've try to find at google but I couldn't find a "easy" one
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi, echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward i believe
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Aoi	Blackwell, I see.
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Blackwell	wood1: a friendly smile, a six-pack of beer on the admin's desk, that may be all you need to get over that port block. :)
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac, oh just only it? wow nat rlz lol
2005-01-01T04:51:00.000Z	wood1	Oh no
2005-01-01T04:52:00.000Z	Aoi	wait, if I tur on eth1, my eth0 internet goes down
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Aoi	I can't find a clear nat howto
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Pozac	the interface is down? or just can't connect?
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	martin_	guys, in the terminal, when i want to use a command i have to first type gnome-terminal (and then) --help, for example. is there a way to make gnome-terminal a passive command or something?
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Aoi	if eth1 up, eth0 can't connect
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Aoi, are they the same type of card?
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi, Are you sure you want nat and not just ip masq?
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	wood1	hey guys and dolls, isn't there no way to connect to this chatroom from PCs whose port 6667 are blocked ?
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, yes
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, I have 2 sis and 1 via
2005-01-01T04:53:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi, bring eth1 up first
2005-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Aoi, then you need aliases for the modules iirc
2005-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	Aoi	1 sis eth0, another sis eth1 (the via one I don't mind)
2005-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	Aoi	modules iirc linux_mafia ? I don't understand O-o
2005-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	Aoi	Pozac, eth1 up but not active let me test
2005-01-01T04:54:00.000Z	martin_	guys, in the terminal, when i want to use a command i have to first type gnome-terminal (and then) --help, for example. is there a way to make gnome-terminal a passive command or something?....
2005-01-01T04:55:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, We don't understand your question
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, How would you run a simple command like 'mount' instead of gnome-terminal (from the terminal?)
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	macewan	you mean something like: man tomboy
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, you mean thats just the way it is in the terminal?
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	macewan	help instructions
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	wood1	Pozac, do you know a way to connect to this chatroom ?
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, how about when i go to tty?
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	Aoi	pozac, if I turn on eth1, eth0 can't connect
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	wood1	macewan
2005-01-01T04:56:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, (and please don't just repeat it, it's not a nice thing to do like in real life)
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, in real life if someone doesnt hear you, its the most logical thing to do...
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	Pozac	wood1, Dont known.. have your admin open up the port
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, But we heard you
2005-01-01T04:57:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, ok sorry nevermind. i wont do that again
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, what exactly do you need to do?
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	Pozac	clicking the terminal shortcut is the same action as running gnome-terminal
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	Pozac	Aoi, hmm
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, im just trying to learn linux.. my first time
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Aoi, sorry was on phone, you there?
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	martin_	and typing gnome-terminal before each command can get really annoying
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	macewan	Pozac: You said earlier that compiling isn't needed on Ubuntu.
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, it's ok, hang in there :)
2005-01-01T05:00:00.000Z	martin_	isnt there a way to bypass it?
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, you should _never_ need to type gnome-terminal
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, yes
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	martin_	but Pozac, if for example i type --help in the terminal window, it says unkown command
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	macewan	Pozac: why is it not needed?
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	martin_	only if i type gnome-terminal --help it works
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, I'm trying to figure out how to "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
2005-01-01T05:01:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, --help is not a command :) mount is a command
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	martin_	oh.
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Aoi, ok, i havent done this for ever, but basically, you cant have the same module used for 2 pieces of hardware
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	grelli	I'm running hoary right now, and there seems to be a dependancy issue with things needing python 2.3, and 2.4 being standard in ubuntu.  I know hoary is development and I shouldn't be whining, but is there a way to fix that?
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, where can i get a list of commands then?
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, I'm used to "su -"
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, type ls /usr/bin
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, oh I see, what I'm supposed to do in my case?
2005-01-01T05:02:00.000Z	Aoi	linux_mafia, eth are loading ok, but I can't figure out how to setup it
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	martin_	it says no such directory, Pozac
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, In linux (unix) all executable files are in /bin and /usr/bin
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	Pozac	note the slash / .. not \ like windows
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	pw	Pozac: that's not right; what about /usr/X11R6/bin
2005-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	pw	?
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	Pozac	pw, true.. and the rest of $PATH
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	macewan	Pozac: I guess because the packages can be retrieved via apt-get? :)
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	martin_	well it says theres no such directory Pozac
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	martin_	although ls works
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, why are you typing commands? what do you want to do?
2005-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	crimsun	grelli: you should not be whining :)
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	Pozac	Otherwise, you really should be clicking around in ubuntu's gorgeus Gnome :)
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	crimsun	grelli: for the most part, the transition to python2.4 is going smoothly
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mojo	ala
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mojo	x-mas is close
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	pw	jingle bells
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	mojo	merry x-mas all ubuntu-users and developers
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	macewan	not everyone celebrates christmas
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	Blackwell	i wonder how long it will take for that x-mas thing to turn sour this year. :)
2005-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	grelli	crimsun there just seems to be a few packages that still depend on 2.3
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	Pozac	macewan, sorry, the packages can.. from the wiki FAQ
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	mojo	I'm not christian but I still celebrate x-mas for the sake of all ppl
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	Blackwell	i predict one more day until people start with their yearly "yeah, yeah, f*cking happy x-crap, move on ffs..." ;)
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	etorix	e crimsun

2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, i want to learn how to use linux through commands, not through graphics...
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	martin_	i can do that through windows
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, then you need to read
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	Pozac	hehe
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, thats why i asked where can i read
2005-01-01T05:06:00.000Z	pw	martin_: It might be an idea for you to get a good Linux boox.
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	pw	er.
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	pw	Book.
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Pozac	yah
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	pw	Try "Running Linux".
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Blackwell	martin_: it helps to have some gui to get something going and working at all. believe me...you cannot avoid "OS sex" with linux. ;)
2005-01-01T05:07:00.000Z	Blackwell	martin_: hell, not even os x manages to keep the unix backend away from you.
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	macewan	linux.org may have links to such things martin_
2005-01-01T05:08:00.000Z	Pozac	linuxdoc.org perhaps
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	pw	martin_: If you really, really, really want to "learn linux" then you should install Linux From Scratch.
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	bassinboy	Chibifs?
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	pw	None of that wussy hand-holding "distribution" nonsense.
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	etorix	o'reilly is always good
2005-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	Blackwell	martin_: if available to you, consider installing linux in a vmware environment. allows for quickly testing various distros, etc. without any risk of destroying your existing pc configuration.

2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	micsch	what happens if i uninstall ubuntu-desktop?
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	grelli	I know how things get
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	Pozac	micsch, nothing
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	micsch	realy
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	Pozac	micsch, ubuntu-desktop just depends on what the ubuntu desktop should contain
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	Pozac	so if you only remove that, it shouldnt change anything
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	crimsun	etorix: how is it complaining?
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	Pozac	unless the devs change how they want the desktop to be
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	mknisely	Can anyone assist with installing a Sonicwall Long Range Wireless card?
2005-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	etorix	i tell a lie .. it sees it

2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	pw	that may point you in the right direction viz: what the card really is
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	mknisely	the linux-wlan makes no mention of a Sonicwall Card.
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	pw	on the face of it, it looks like it's a prism2 based card.
2005-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	mknisely	I know that it has a Prism2 chip.
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	mknisely	I must drop.... will return.

2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	garcia79	no....
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	Pozac	gstreamer-mad enables rhythmbox and beep-media-player to play mp3s
2005-01-01T05:36:00.000Z	crimsun	garcia79: pon ...?

2005-01-01T05:38:00.000Z	martin_	pozac, any idea why it would give me that error?
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, try running gst-register-0.8 in the terminal
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	martin_	heh thanks
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	martin_	:)
2005-01-01T05:39:00.000Z	Pozac	np ;)
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	martin_	pozac, if i want to get bittorrent or bittornado for linux, how can i do that?
2005-01-01T05:40:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, it's in apt :)
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	martin_	synaptic?
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	Pozac	yep
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	crimsun	just Search for bittorrent, select it, then Apply
2005-01-01T05:41:00.000Z	martin_	gui stands for graphic user interface?
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	Pozac	yep
2005-01-01T05:42:00.000Z	Pozac	or sudo apt-get install bittorrent in terminal :)
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	martin_	whats this sudo thing?
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	martin_	i mean where does it come from?
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	martin_	or what does it represent
2005-01-01T05:43:00.000Z	crimsun	it comes from OpenBSD
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Pozac	SUperuser DO
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	crimsun	it allows you to run a command as a different user, by default the root user
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	martin_	oh cool
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	martin_	why do i want to run a command as a different user?
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Pozac	you need to be in /etc/sudoers
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, superuser
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	martin_	what are these etc/ libraries
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	crimsun	it's akin to the su(1) command but provides a command audit trail
2005-01-01T05:44:00.000Z	martin_	i dont understand how these things work
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, in /etc lies configuration files
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, for easy backing up
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	martin_	ok . . .
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: Ubuntu does not configure the 'root' user's account by default in an attempt to foster more secure administration methods
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	martin_	man isnt there a walkthrough for linux with all the commands and what you hsould start with?
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	martin_	whats this root thing
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	riffic	hey I figured out the resolution problem I was having yesterday
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	martin_	?
2005-01-01T05:45:00.000Z	Pozac	not really...
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	riffic	I edited xorg.conf for the monitor refresh rate settings..
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	Pozac	linux is generally not a toy, you need a purpose :)
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	paulproteus	martin_: http://www.physics.ubc.ca/mbelab/computer/linux-intro/html/ might help you
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: therefore you'd preface a command with sudo to run the command as root, since many system administration tasks require root privileges
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	riffic	but I guess XFree86.conf takes precedence
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	riffic	and it needed the settings too
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	Pozac	Eating time. Later. :)
2005-01-01T05:46:00.000Z	riffic	so if anyone cares that's how I fixed
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	Blackwell	riffic: document
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	martin_	cool .
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	Blackwell	that's the shame of irc, nothing of it goes into the archives, such as google and co. ;|
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	paulproteus	martin_: There's a lot of documentation out there on the web.  Googling is helpful.
2005-01-01T05:47:00.000Z	paulproteus	Blackwell: That's why the most successful channels have wikis tied to them. :)
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	crimsun	Blackwell: bots can log if necessary, though we encourage wiki and mailing list use first and foremost
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	Blackwell	paulproteus: hm, feeding the logs into those wikis?
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	paulproteus	Blackwell: No, having users document what they discover on wikis.
2005-01-01T05:48:00.000Z	Blackwell	who is actually sitting down and doing that kind of work? a few power helpers do, that's it in my experience. :|
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	Blackwell: Yeah, guess that's true.
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	crimsun	Blackwell: thus it is _everyone's_ job to encourage wiki and mailing list use
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	Blackwell: #joiito has a bot that lets any user blog.
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	Mojo_Jojo	anyone here know anyting about gnomemeeting?
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	Like:
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	Blackwell	paulproteus: and they actually do that? i can tell that the majority of the java newbie bozos don't give a funk. of course...they are only interested in getting their homework done and over with. ;)
2005-01-01T05:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	?blog I got (thing) to work by reading (URL)
2005-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	paulproteus	Blackwell: Well, #joiito is a social channel, not a tech channel.
2005-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	Blackwell	paulproteus: hm. "pubic hair is explained at ..."? ;) just kidding.
2005-01-01T05:50:00.000Z	Blackwell	yay if it works. i have seen to many leeches on irc.
2005-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	martin_	paulproteus, thanks.
2005-01-01T05:52:00.000Z	martin_	xskoulax|zzzz, music workin well :)
2005-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	martin_	paulproteus, i used synapt to get bittorent and installed it... how do i know where it is installed and how do i run it>
2005-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	tck	has anyone used an infra-red device with warty ?
2005-01-01T05:53:00.000Z	paulproteus	martin_: If you click on a dot-torrent file in Firefox it will open with BitTorrent.
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Findeton	hi!
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	usual	man gstreamer sucks
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	amathis	what is a good program for scanning"?
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Findeton	i got ubuntu installed
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	martin_	paulproteus, ok thanks... but how do i know where its installed?
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	paulproteus	In Synaptic, you can find the file list for a package.
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: the Python scripts are installed into /usr/bin, as most executables and scripts are
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	Findeton	and, well, when i installed mldonkey... it got the 2.5-21 version, which is totally broken
2005-01-01T05:54:00.000Z	paulproteus	Files in directories with "bin" in them are program parts.
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Findeton	i installed via synaptic, i mean
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	Findeton	...
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	martin_	crimsun, how do i get into those libraries?
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	paulproteus	btdownloadgui is the most straightforward to understand.
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	paulproteus	martin_: You run it on a terminal, like:
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	linux_mafia	amathis, scanning what?
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	paulproteus	btdownloadgui /path/to/file.torrent
2005-01-01T05:55:00.000Z	amathis	linux_mafia: with a scanner o.,o
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	Findeton	i think the mldonkey version of ubuntu should be upgraded to a new one
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	linux_mafia	amathis, ok, was thinking nmap, use xsane
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	Findeton	;)
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	Findeton	2.5-28h for example
2005-01-01T05:56:00.000Z	martin_	btdownloadgui? whats that?
2005-01-01T05:57:00.000Z	etorix	an alternative to btdownloadcurses
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	martin_	that doesnt tell me much :)
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: it has a graphical interface as opposed to a command line curses-based one.
2005-01-01T05:58:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: a window, icons, etc.
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	martin_	ah ok...
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	martin_	well thanks guys , bbl.
2005-01-01T05:59:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: ncurses is a terminal-based library, hence it's used for command-line applications
2005-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	amathis	how can I see what devices ( usb) are connected to my puter'
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	crimsun	lsusb(1) reports all usb devices
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	crimsun	from that you can deduce which are connected
2005-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	crimsun	there's also a program called usbview
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	crimsun	(in universe)
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	amathis	ugh
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	amathis	wtf
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	amathis	this scanner is hooked up
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	amathis	but xsane cannot figure it out :(
2005-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	amathis	Bus 001 Device 002: ID 03f0:0801 Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 7400c
2005-01-01T06:11:00.000Z	fender	tha_game|away:had any luck with dvdrip?
2005-01-01T06:12:00.000Z	bassinboy	Chibifs?
2005-01-01T06:13:00.000Z	fender	tha_game|away: did you find any infromation on dvdrip or any other program that could take audio from a dvd.
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	lkerscher	hi @ all
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	crimsun	'lo
2005-01-01T06:14:00.000Z	pisuke	http://kwiki.ffii.org/Cons041221En :)
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	fender	tha_game|away: are you there?
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Hi
2005-01-01T06:15:00.000Z	lkerscher	i have a question: can I copy this sources (http://www.entropia.de/cms/pub/Main/LinuxStartSeite/sources.list.stable.internet) in my souces.list from ubuntu without any problems?
2005-01-01T06:16:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Anyone knows what "FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.9-1-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid module format" means?
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	crimsun	DoktorTomoe: what gave you that error?
2005-01-01T06:17:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	hm, i tried to modprobe ndiswrapper (to get wlan)
2005-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	lkerscher	hello?
2005-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	DoktorTomoe: you're running Hoary?
2005-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: one sec.
2005-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	crimsun: Yes
2005-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	lkerscher	okay thanks
2005-01-01T06:18:00.000Z	crimsun	DoktorTomoe: checked bugzilla?
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	crimsun: Where can I find it?
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	crimsun	DoktorTomoe: linked from the Ubuntu web site
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	anir	hey guys where can i get linspire??
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	crimsun	anir: from Linspire's home page, of course.
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Blackwell: I'm just trying to get this machine working :)
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	anir	crimsun: i am looking for a free distro
2005-01-01T06:19:00.000Z	adbak	anir: ubuntu is a free distro
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	fender	need some help with extracting audio from a dvd, asked same question yesterday, some help offered from tha_game|away, but he doesn't seem to be online at the moment.
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	anir	crimsun: i have to pay for linspire...why??
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: um, no, you cannot use that list in your sources.list without breaking many, many things.
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	anir	adbak: can i get linspire for free?
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	lkerscher	hm fuck
2005-01-01T06:20:00.000Z	lkerscher	and any party of thislist?
2005-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	crimsun	fender: do you have mplayer installed?
2005-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	adbak	anir: i have no clue, but go to distrowatch.com and there's a little drop-down menu.  find linspire on it and it will tell you the website for linspire
2005-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: some companies make money off of putting together a very ease to use linux distribution. if you don't want to pay for them, that's ok.
2005-01-01T06:21:00.000Z	fender	can't get mplayer to work, or dvdrip or transcode or fffmpeg, real problem i'm having.
2005-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	anir	adbek: i searched.. it charges $20.. but i am from India.. so its impossible for me to pay
2005-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: it's not a good idea to randomly add sources.
2005-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	anir	hey all u linux guys listen..
2005-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	lkerscher	okay so I have to search some promgrams manually?
2005-01-01T06:22:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: furthermore, those aren't necessary for Ubuntu, which includes most of those packages in either main, universe, or multiverse repos
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	anir	i have seen some problems with linux...
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	fender	can't get mplayer to work, or dvdrip or transcode or fffmpeg, real problem i'm having.
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	anir	you guys should look into these
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: you should enable the universe and multiverse repos in Synaptic if you want some of those packages. Ubuntu already includes most of them.
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	hey guys
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	anir	why Linux uses multiple GUI???
2005-01-01T06:23:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	i have a question
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	lkerscher	hm and how to do that?
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: that package list was written for Debian Woody. Ubuntu Warty is much newer than Debian Woody.
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	anyone have any idea how to setup a Motorola SM56 PCI modem in ubuntu?
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	adbak	crimsun: for multiverse do you just copy the universe repo and replace uni- with multi-?
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	it seems that ubuntu recognises it under 'device settings'
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: follow the instructions for Restricted formats on the wiki.
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	anir	listen to me..
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	adbak	anir: for choices.  some people like one over another.  some work better on older machines
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: because people can't agree on a single one. if you want less choice, consider sticking to windows or better mac.
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	lkerscher	okay
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	lkerscher	thank you
2005-01-01T06:24:00.000Z	crimsun	adbak: you could do that, sure. You can also enable it in Synaptic.
2005-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	anir	i am not talking about me only.. i am talking about the average home users..
2005-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	adbak	crimsun: but there is no multiverse repo when you install ubuntu.  you have to manually add it
2005-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	the average home user will be pleased with GNOME 2.8
2005-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	hence its selection as a default desktop for Warty
2005-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	anir	many of home pc users dont want to install linux because its less  user friendly..
2005-01-01T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	adbak: that's the idea
2005-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	adbak: it shouldn't be "installed" by default. A small subset of fully-supported packages is good.
2005-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	anir	the question is not Independence to CHOOSE its independence to NOT have to choose
2005-01-01T06:26:00.000Z	crimsun	anir: GNOME 2.8 is hardly user-friendly.
2005-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	adbak	crimsun: yes, i agree, i was just trying to say that i can't enable it in synaptic cuz i don't have it in my sources.list
2005-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	err, user-unfriendly.
2005-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	crimsun	adbak: it should be in your sources.list by default, just commented out
2005-01-01T06:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: if you don't want to choose, there are options you can...erh...choose that are good for that state of mind.
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	crimsun: this ndiswrapper problem is not mentioned in bugzilla. Given the information I have is relatively small ("does not work"), is in really good to file a bug report?
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	lkerscher	sorry but which is that wiki-adress?
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	adbak	anir: linux, in general, may be less user-friendly, but that gap is quickly being closed.  not to mention some (avg home users) are scared off because of the learning curve. they're used to their windows
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	crimsun	lkerscher: also linked from Ubuntu's web site.
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: you may have "standardization" in mind. i agree that standardization in the way of windows and mac os x is important and good. but you won't find many fans of that among unix people.
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	bsd people on the other hand....enjoy the fruits of standardization every single day, too.
2005-01-01T06:28:00.000Z	crimsun	DoktorTomoe: it's your call, really, but Hoary _is_ a moving target, and things are expected to break. You could wait a couple days and see if linux-image-2.6.9-1-386 is updated again.
2005-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	anir	crimsun: see .. an average user dont want to keep trying a newer version of OS everyother day.... what i get in KDE i get diferent feel in GNOME..
2005-01-01T06:29:00.000Z	crimsun	anir: do you expect the average user to try every available desktop environment?
2005-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	crimsun	anir: or do you think (s)he will stick with one that works, one that is aesthetically-pleasing, and one that is efficient?
2005-01-01T06:30:00.000Z	crimsun	anir: for instance, by choosing to try both KDE and GNOME, you've already crossed outside the definition of the "average" home user. Your expectations of the "average" home user thus are irrelevant.
2005-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	anir	crimsun:..indeed they dont..well i want to solve problems with the computer.. not create.. right..
2005-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: What exactly is your problem in choosing one of the GUIs?
2005-01-01T06:31:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: Just choose the one which most of the applications you want to use are written for. That's KDE for me,
2005-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	anyone have any idea how to setup a Motorola SM56 PCI modem in ubuntu?
2005-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	anir	crimsun: thats what i am trying to say.. i am confused which one suits me best..there are so many linux os.. but without any stahdard..like for eg.. windows or OS x uses only one GUI
2005-01-01T06:32:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: I didn't want to sound harsh or impolite, but I really do not understand your problem...
2005-01-01T06:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: that is the problem with linux. if you don't like so much choice...there isn't much that can be done about it.
2005-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	anir	doktortomoe: i am trying 3 different linux os from last one week or so.. in search of which one suits me best.. but why should i invest all the time??
2005-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	anir	blackwell: do u think its good?
2005-01-01T06:34:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: If you actually have been trying 3 different distributions (please do not call them OS), why have you done it?
2005-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	anir	coz this time i had the time..why should someone who is busy like hell should do it doktortomoe
2005-01-01T06:35:00.000Z	adbak	anir: if the abundance of choices is not pleasing, you can always accept the defaults
2005-01-01T06:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: to have choice? yes, to have choice is good. however, in the java software development field there is often too much (dubious) choice, and it actually hurts people. what you should consider perhaps it to ignore everything that is not mainstream. that helps to cut away of lot of first level choices.
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: Actually, I am busy like hell (IT Freelancer), but I know what I want, and how to get it. And I know how to obtain the software I need. Therefore, I do not really invest time, unless I think it is important.
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: you seem to assume that all the linux distros out there are made for one particular group of users. that is however not so. if you are in a hurry, you don't have time to learn something new. so let a consultant tell you what you need or get what you already know. if you are unhappy with the stuff you already know...linux is in the box of options again.
2005-01-01T06:37:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: Important could mean "hazzlefree in respect of malware" for John User
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	anir	guys i think lindows is a good choice for me.. but i dont want to invest some money to try it..
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	anir	now comes ELX..
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: then don't. don't buy the cat in the sack.
2005-01-01T06:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	(as we say in germany)
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: besides, who will help you with lindows? lindows is by far, far, far NOT linux mainstream.
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: See, this is choice - you choose not to. now you have options left. (btw: any other germans in here?=
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: in other words: you are about to get yourself a freak linux distro. i advise against that.
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	guys... guys.... let it go... i'm sure the man can make his own choices
2005-01-01T06:39:00.000Z	anir	blackwell: is lindows is not good???
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	etorix_	you should never have to pay for a linux ..
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: do you know anyone who uses it?
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	Blackwell	etorix: bullshit
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: Lindows would be the WindowsXP of Linux if SuSE wasn't in existance.
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	chill dudes
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	adbak	anir: if you want a popular distro that does not offer much choice and is user-friendly, try Fedora (http://fedora.redhat.com) or Mandrake
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	Blackwell	if the distro is good and meets your requirements, it can be easily worth twice the price of an xp server license. :)
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	etorix_: I really am willing to pay for a linux if it was well configured for my needs.
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	etorix_	so am i
2005-01-01T06:40:00.000Z	Blackwell	DoktorTomoe: right on :)
2005-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	Blackwell	so was i...when i decided to buy mandrake...
2005-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	Blackwell	and then i found out they don't have any "pay on delivery" options in germany. :)
2005-01-01T06:41:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	etorix_: my time is valuable too, and if I save more on time than on linux, I'll get my money
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	Hutch192	Hi all. anybody know how to upgrade to Firefox 1.0 ?
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	anir	but the problem i am getting here is .. i have not been able to play mpeg4  files in UBUNTU..in other one i may not be able to run DVD
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	Tyche	You would have to use Hoary
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	etorix_	i repeat .. you should never have to pay for a linux ..
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Hutch192: I just downloaded it from firefox and ran the installer as root...
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	etorix_: this seems kinda off-topic
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	anir	hutch192: go to there site
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	anir: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	anir: it's in the FAQ...
2005-01-01T06:42:00.000Z	anir	bob2: i have done everything given there
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Tyche	Anyone use a easy to use powerful CMS that would be good for a personal site?
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: Where is the problem? I got vlc installes pretty easy. It now plays virtually any file format.
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	anir: I can play mpeg-4 files fine
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	adbak	anir: what do you use to play movies?
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	Hutch192	DoktorTomoe: so did i. but i turned to be version 0.9.6
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	Tyche: drupal is kinda cool, but php
2005-01-01T06:43:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Hutch: you might want to change the link firefox in /usr/bin
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	anir	doktortomoe: i have vlc too.. it too does not play anything.. says the pulgin needed to handle the movie is not available
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	pisuke	bye
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	adbak	anir: have you tried gxine?
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	anir: are you sure you installed correctly?
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Hutch192	DoktorTomoe: i did that too.
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	anir	yes i did
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Hutch192	DoktorTomoe: i mean if there is a .deb package for ff 1.0
2005-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	Tyche	PHP is good thing, bob2
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	anir	i tried totem-xine and vlc
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	Tyche: in insecure-land, maybe ;-)
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Hutch192: Which directory did you install ff 1.0 to? (I am not aware of an ff1.0-deb)
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Tyche	bob2, and what is a good secure alternative? asp? =)
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	Hutch192	DoktorTomoe: /usr/local/Firefox/
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	jpvcx	Hutch192: ubuntu-backport should have it.... i think.
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Tyche: have you heard of PERL?
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	bob2	Tyche: perl, python, ruby
2005-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	adbak	Hutch192: there's Ffx 1.0 in the ubuntu bakcports repo
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	erk, I really wouldn't trust the 'backports' repository
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	Hutch192: what's the killer feature 1.0 has that you want?
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Tyche	DoktorTomoe: Yea, do I know how to use it. No. Is there a CMS that would use any of those?
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	zenwhen	they work fine on all the machines I have used them on
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	anir	bob2: how will i get the output? in the terminal?
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	bob2	anir: yes.
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	zenwhen	which would be 9 machines all running stock warty
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	thisfred	Tyche: zope uses python
2005-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	Hutch192	bob2: RSS.
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	thisfred	Tyche: and there are a number of CMS'es built on top of Zope
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	bob2	like plone!
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	zenwhen	I don;t see the reason to bash projects that are meant to give people access to the applications they want.
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	bob2	zenwhen: I'm not bashing anything, I'm just a bit concerned about how it started
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	anir	bob2: can u type the command again plz
2005-01-01T06:47:00.000Z	bob2	03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	thisfred	like Plone indeed, or CPS, or Silva (disclaimer: I work for Infrae, the company that made Silva)
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	Hm, anyone got an idea how I change a distro on a webserver remotely? (Dont want suse, want debian)
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	zenwhen	bob2, I was just stating that the backports project hosts some quality debs.
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	zenwhen	No biggie. :P
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	bob2	DoktorTomoe: you don't
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	anir	is there a space between libavcodec2 and | and tail ?? bob2
2005-01-01T06:48:00.000Z	bob2	anir: doesn't matter
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	anir	its says command not found bob2
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	bob2	zenwhen: well, if you say so...
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	bob2	anir: er, are you sure you didn't make a typo?
2005-01-01T06:49:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	bob2: I thought I've seen it before. I didn't care at that point of time, however.
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	macewan	off hand does anyone know the correct sources.list for debian unstable?
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	bob2	DoktorTomoe: there's debtakeover, but I really really wouldn't do that on a machine that's actually needed
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	anir	it says bash: dpkg-l: command not found; bash:tail-nl: command not found bob2
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	bob2	anir: please read what I wrote again
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	ACID|net	when using samba, how can u view the share as a different user??
2005-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	bob2	*carefully*
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	ACID|net	share on the windows machine
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	anir	bob2 typo?
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	bob2	anir: you made at least two typoes
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: for what repo?
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	anir	bob2: what is typoes?
2005-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	bob2	anir: ? just type what I wrote originally, without removing any of the space I had
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Blackwell	"typing is smotheing i dno't konw how to do porprley"
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Blackwell	"typo" is very related.
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	anir	bob2: whth the colons?? '  '
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	macewan	grabbing newer version of alsa - someone recommend unstable
2005-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	bob2	anir: ? just cut and paste what I said
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: are you running Warty or Hoary?
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	macewan	warty
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: 1.0.6 should be new "enough". Any reason you need Sid/Hoary's 1.0.7?
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	anir	bob2: bash: dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1?: command not found
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	(fwiw, there are a few alsa-lib problems with 1.0.7)
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	bob2	anir: I didn't type that
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	bob2	03:47:48           bob2 | 03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	macewan	1.0.6? I'm seeing 1.0.5
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	Anybody have any idea how good Audacity is?
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: are you referring to alsa-driver or alsa-lib?
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	macewan	driver
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	[Phaedrus] : I find it more than adequate for my needs
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: apt-cache policy alsa-source
2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: sudo apt-get install alsa-source && more /usr/share/doc/alsa-source/README.Debian
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	macewan	1.0.5a is what I'm seeing
2005-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	macewan	for the source

2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	krischan	guys, an XMMS-related question: how do I enable XMMS to play back MIDI files? I heard about the 'xmms-midi' plugin, but I can't find it in Ubuntu's repos.
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	anir	bob2: can u help me?
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	andy	hi guys... i just installed Ubuntu onto my pismo powerbook and during installation I made my ethernet port the default networking port.  however it didn't seem to install support for my airport card though.  how do i go about installing that as well?
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: you can have someone remotely look over your shoulder, too, in case this is somehow not working out.
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	pick someone willing to help and make sure to only allow looking, not actual controlling of your desktop.
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	bob2	andy: just load the airport module and then use iwconfig
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	bbl
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	anir	blackwell: will u help me?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	03:54:26           bob2 | 03:47:48           bob2 | 03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	run that command
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	is there an unofficial ubuntu website that people find to be helpufl?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	adbak	krischan: i don't know what plugin is needed for xmms, but tse3play is a midi players
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	andy	bob2: how do I find the airport module? via terminal?
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	anir	bob2: when i copy and paste everything.. from 03:54...till -nl'?.. it gives command not found
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	andy: modprobe airport, yes
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	andy	thanks :)
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	andy: dude, you're not copying what I wrote
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	adbak	youre welcome
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	er, anir
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: it is not recommended that you randomly add the Sid binary packages line to /etc/apt/sources.list. Much weeping and gnashing of teeth may ensue. Instead, you may be able to grab the package from Sid's pool manually and install it.
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	anir: please just cut and paste it carefully
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	anir	bob2: whtever i am typing it says command not found..
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	andy	bob2: huh? not copying it?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	do you need to be superuser?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	andy: not talking to you
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	adbak: no
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	andy	lol, k
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	bob2, you have your hands full
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	:
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	:)
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Tyche	Thanks for your feedback.
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Tyche	I'm going to download and do some testing on these CMS. Are any of them in warty?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	drupal is
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	anir	thats why i dont want to use linux
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	just stayaway from the *nukes
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	anir	it makes u frastrated
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	anir: well, you're not copying what I said
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Tyche	anir it is worth it.
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	the command I showed you to use works fine
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	anir	bob2: i am simply copying it
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	etorix_	worked here too
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Tyche	bob2, agreed I don't like the *nukes.
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	anir: well, I'm not sure what's going on then, since it works for me and etorix_, and what you're showing me is not what I typed
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	andy	bob2: sorry to be a pain, but "modprobe airport" didn't seem to do anything
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	etorix_	un  libavcodec2    <none>         (no description available)
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Tyche	bob2, Still learning debian. Once I install drupal, where do I find docs? Or where did it get installed to?
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	anir	bob2: do i have to use 'sudo'?
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	andy: it just loads the module, then you need to configure it...
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	andy: no
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	anir: no
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	Tyche: /usr/share/doc/drupal/* ?
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	andy: 'iwconfig' is the command you want
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	bassinboy	Chibifs?
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	CheeseMapping	I'm about to make one of those snap decisions.  should be fun
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	anir	bob2:i will paste.....03:54:26           bob2 | 03:47:48           bob2 | 03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?...then i will press enter..right?
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	anir: no, just the bit I put in quotes
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cheese	Does ubuntu have good package management?
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	if you don't understand something someone says to you, it's much much much much easier if you just say so
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	etorix_	apt
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Cheese: excellent. It's based on Debian.
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	Cheese: of course, it's based on Debian
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	etorix_	i <3 apt
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cheese	great. I'm SO there.
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	CheatersRealm, yea... ubuntuforums
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cheese	time to snag an ISO and a CD
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	anir	bob2:okay i will paste.... 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'? and  press enter...okay this time??
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Cheese	Debian irritated me because the liveCD and actual install didn't support my 160gb hd for no apparent reason.
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	debian doesn't have a live cd
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Cheese	the install disc is one
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	thx nomasteryoda
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	no it's not
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	etorix_	harddly
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	np
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Tyche	crimsun: It is there, thank you. Doesn't say anything about the debian install. Does synaptic just put it on the machine and then you install it like the instructions say? moving and copying, setting up DB, etc.
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	anir: without the quotes, yes
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Cheese	it boots into linux to install. imo, it's a livecd
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bob2, noobs
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	etorix_	no its not
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Tyche: I presume so; the README*s will be more helpful.
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	nomasteryoda: 'noobs'?
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Cheese	course, by that definition, that'd make everything a liveCD, so that probobly is wrong
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Cheese: a live CD is more along the lines of Knoppix or Ubuntu's livecd or MandrakeMove
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	anir	bob2:  okay i am giving you the out put..
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	anir	bob2: tail: 1?: invalid number of lines
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	anir	No packages found matching libavcodec2.
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	ok then
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Cheese	crimsun, I present to you the following: Gentoo calls their install discs liveCDs
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Cheese: good thing this isn't Gentoo (the distro), eh? :)
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Tyche	cruimsun: Thanks, I will keep searching.
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	anir	so bob2 what should i do?
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	Cheese: gentoo says lots of things that may or may not be sensible ;-)
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Cheese	bob2: very true
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bob2, the Debian "liveCD"
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	bob2	anir: erm, I think you should read wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats again and make sure you followedthe instructions correctly
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	Cheese	crimsun: compiling everything was a learning experience.  I learned that on a 450mhz box it takes a while, and that the Gentoo_Mirrors aren't always up to date
2005-01-01T07:16:00.000Z	Cheese	that gets REALLY old REALLY fast
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	ixane	that's better.
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	anir	bob2: do i need to install libavcodec2?
2005-01-01T07:17:00.000Z	ixane	wow. I'm getting a fast torrent too!
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	ixane	once I installed new network modules in XP it stopped blue-screening after 20 mins
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	ixane	blah. XP.
2005-01-01T07:18:00.000Z	anir	guys why did you say that lindows is not linux?

2005-01-01T07:21:00.000Z	zenwhen	yeah, Id say thats good enough of a reason to say its not quite Linux alone
2005-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	Pozac	They should have named it Linux 98 instead
2005-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	anir	under which section i will see bob2
2005-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	bob2	anir: see what?

2005-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	bob2	er, didn't you say you'd already read it?
2005-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	netmole	i will participate as translator for Ubuntu linux in my native language czech
2005-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	netmole	how i contact responsible preson ?

2005-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	smurfix	netmole: Are there any ubuntu-specific czech Web pages etc.?

2005-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	netmole	i order cd by cd shipping system
2005-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	netmole	ok

2005-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	anir	bob2: what is the meaning of there is no plugin to handle the movie??
2005-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	anir: you need to provide waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more context
2005-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	but if you can't play a movie generally, don't expect to be able to play it in a browser
2005-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	scizzo	anir: you haven't read the information on the site if you don't know that
2005-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	bob2	I'd suggesting reading the wiki page again and making sure you've understood it all
2005-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	scizzo	anir: "These formats are patent-encumbered. If you do not require compatibility with MPEG-4 players, consider Ogg Theora."

2005-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	you need to read the section on the page that explains how to install mplayer or gxine or such
2005-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	scizzo	anir: maybe you should start to learn about patent and stuff also
2005-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	fhsioe	i hope software patents in europe to stay as now, illegal
2005-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	fhsioe	;)

2005-01-01T07:47:00.000Z	trukulo	rhodan, use it

2005-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	rhodan	trukulo: tar.gz
2005-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, why it's better?
2005-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	trukulo	rhodan, look in detailed
2005-01-01T07:48:00.000Z	trukulo	what's theme for? gtk? metacity? icons?
2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	anir	trukulo: i dont know why.. i am an unbiased commentator
2005-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, in my system i can see it very well
2005-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	rhodan	trukulo: thank you it now loaded the theme, however the icons do not load, do they have to go anywhere specific ? it's gtk2
2005-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	trukulo	icons are another download
2005-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	tritium	Are the python-fixedpoint and python-mpz packages being permanently removed from Hoary?
2005-01-01T07:51:00.000Z	trukulo	themes are separated in three, gtk, metacity and icons
2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	rhodan	trukulo: ok, but in this archive file there is a directory called icons
2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	trukulo	but i think it's for controls
2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	trukulo	try open nautilus
2005-01-01T07:52:00.000Z	anir	trukulo:may be i need some plugins

2005-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	anir	plz comment guys
2005-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	xelerated	ubuntu owns!
2005-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	xelerated	finally a debian distro without the headaches
2005-01-01T07:58:00.000Z	anir	owns??
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	anir	xelerated: think you dont have internet connection.. is it worth having Ubuntu??
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	xelerated	yes its worth it
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	anir	to an extent linux  sux
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	...
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	anir	xelerated: how??
2005-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	xelerated	and to a greater extent windows sucks
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	JStrike	No version of linux is all that great without an internet connection
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, what if you have only a windows cd a unplugged computer?
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	trukulo	do you think windows is good?
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	anir	xelerated: how will you get the softwares if you dont have net connected??
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	xelerated	anir, what do you mean how? you can do word processing, lots of games, all sorts of stuff
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	JStrike	Windows is by far a better option if you dont have an internet connection
2005-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	xelerated	you are on line right now.... why not download it now
2005-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, how? playing solitaire and writing with wordpad?
2005-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	anir	xelerated: i can atleast play movie, play games and do all sort of things without downloading any softwares from the net in windows
2005-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	xelerated	yea and i can play movies and play all sorts of games in linux without getting online
2005-01-01T08:01:00.000Z	jdub	anir: now you're starting to define the issue :)
2005-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	jdub	anir: the problem here is that, for various reasons, FOSS is locked out of a lot of multimedia formats and protocols
2005-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, what games? solitaire and pinball? great
2005-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	anir	but in ububtu i have to download from the net only to configure my system...
2005-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	JStrike	trukulo : What are you on about? No. If you buy a cd, or someone gives you a program, with dependency resolution, linux is pretty useless
2005-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	jpvcx	anir: sure, try playing .ogm files in a fresh windows xp install
2005-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	jdub	anir: so in large part, we cannot use these things easily on linux
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, if anyone gives you a program for windows, that depends on directx9b , and you don't have it... what?
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	jdub	anir: for the more technically minded, there are ways around this, but it involves downloading software because none of it can be shipped with Ubuntu itself for legal reasons
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	trukulo	it's the same problem
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	anir	take for example ... i am downloading 200MB from yesterday..
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	trukulo	i agree with jdub
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	trukulo	problems you're talking about have patent and copyright problems
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	rhodan	trukulo: thanks for your help with the theme
2005-01-01T08:03:00.000Z	JStrike	trukulo : Seems to come with almost anything that needs it
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	trukulo	in ubuntu you have alternatives, just use them
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	jdub	anir: are you using warty or hoary?
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, i disagree
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	anir	jdub i am using warty
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	trukulo	you are talking about windows AND a lot of software installed after installation
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	jdub	anir: ok, so those are the initial security updates available for warty
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	trukulo	software, that it's system separatedly distributed
2005-01-01T08:04:00.000Z	anir	and belive me.. it requires a lot of time to do this..
2005-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	tritium	JStrike, windows never has the tools I need, internet connection or not.
2005-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, but it's only one time installation, upgrades are clean
2005-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	anir	but see in windows.. you will get all the required software in the installing cd only
2005-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	trukulo	jdub, he's talking about marillat repos
2005-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	jdub	anir: you get all the required software from the CD only with ubuntu too, but you have additional needs
2005-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	ACID|net	in samba client, i want to change a directory which has spares - how do i do it??? IMPORTANT
2005-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	JStrike	tritium : I haven't used windows in a long time, but back then, I never came across dependency issues, such as you will have on linux without an internet connection
2005-01-01T08:06:00.000Z	anir	thats why people hasitates to install linux.. as my rommie said
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, if you have repos on cd's with depends, you have no problems
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	trukulo	same as windows
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	trukulo	programs in windows come with depends
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	JStrike	trukulo : Rubish
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	tritium	JStrike, you were just less aware of the DLL hell under the hood with windows
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, think what you want
2005-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	anir	i dont know.. but other than being a bit stable...i dont find any advantages in linux over windows
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, perhaps, you need to read more about linux then
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	JStrike	If someone hands you a cd with a modern game, you can be pretty sure it will run on windows. Not the same with linux
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	jdub	anir: that's ok :)
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	trukulo	what about free software advantage?
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	tritium	JStrike, try installing yahoo messenger or something similar without the latest Internet Explorer if you want dependency hell in windows
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	xelerated	i was just showing a buddy an advantage of my linux box over his windows box, my weather monitor gives me everything his does, but i dont see add's or popups
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	JStrike	And that is not even bringing in the problem with different distros using different versions of libraries
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, it's a problem of support in game companys
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	anir	hope we will get something better linux in the near future which will solve the problems... but till then..
2005-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	zenwhen	You wont find the advantages if you are only using oyur computer for email web browsing and games, and dont care about security or automation.
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	JStrike	I dont have windows, but I am talking about 6-7 years ago when I did
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	|QuaD-	why is this a linx vs windows discussion? we are all in here because we experienced the fact that linux is better then windows... lets move on
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	trukulo	JStrike, then go back windows if you want, i'm really happy with linux
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	anir	now Window is coming with LongHorn... its great..
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	zenwhen	If you donlt see why Linux is a superior platform, you haven;t looked hard enough.
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	ACID|net	hmmm, " " :D
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, why is it great?
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	xelerated	yea, if i didnt care one bit about security, id use windows. But i do care about security, and wont touch windows other than to play an occasional game
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	tritium	anir, what compilers and libraries does Longhorn come with?
2005-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	jdub	dudes, let's leave the windows vs. linux argument please
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	zenwhen	anir, longhorn will be great for people who will also never understand why it is a inferior platform.
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	trukulo	jdub, ok
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	anir	i have just tried transformation package in XP pro... looks great.. feels great.. and most of all  easy to handle.. and i found it very very stable
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	LiLIi1	SERVER: ncn.ircxpro.com | Help Assistants & Global Ops Wanted |
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	JStrike	trukulo : Why should I go back to windows. I was merely stating that you cant tell someone new to linux that it doesn't have those issues
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	LiLIi1	SERVER: ncn.ircxpro.com | Help Assistants & Global Ops Wanted |
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	LiLIi1	SERVER: ncn.ircxpro.com | Help Assistants & Global Ops Wanted |
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	anir	now the ball is in your court LINUX..
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	xelerated	actually i think longhorn might be halfway decent, since they are taking a more serious approch to security, but im sture they will still botch it some
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	jdub	anir: enoug thanks.
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	jdub	xelerated: enough please.
2005-01-01T08:10:00.000Z	zenwhen	The solution to problems with linux for newbies is for them to use it long enough not to be newbies.
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	zenwhen	I dont want linux dumbed down to the point where control is taken away.
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	ACID|net	linux will only really work when OEMs start installing it
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	ACID|net	or at least offering it
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	anir	what happened guys.. say something
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	ACID|net	which will only work when microsoft become less anti-competitive
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	jdub	zenwhen: 'control' and what you're calling 'dumbed down' aren't related.
2005-01-01T08:11:00.000Z	|QuaD-	xelerated: no version of windows will be halfway decent until it is a Windows linux distribution
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	jdub	ACID|net, |QuaD-: enough please.
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	ACID|net	????
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	jpvcx	anir: jdub anir: enoug thanks. <- thats why
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	|QuaD-	jdub: i was trying to stop the convo
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	Simira	hm... when I plug my usb cam, where will it normally mount?
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	zenwhen	jdub, new users will complain about Linux until it is windows.
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	jdub	|QuaD-: a comment like that is not a conversation stopper.
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	|QuaD-	jdub: read above
2005-01-01T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	Simira, look under /media
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	Simira	tritium: nope, only cdroms
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	jdub	|QuaD-: i did, thus my comment.
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	|QuaD-	read my comment before that
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	tritium	Simira, hmm, not for me...usbstick, zip, etc under media
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	anon26	hey all
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	jdub	Simira: camera? it won't mount, it's not a storage device.
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	Simira	tritium: my usb-stick mounts there
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	jdub	|QuaD-: i reacted to your last comment.
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	anon26	anyone know how to get java working in hoary?
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	Simira	jdub: it stores my pics :p
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	anir	guys its nothing about inferrior platform.. tell me why till date more people use windows??
2005-01-01T08:13:00.000Z	Simira	jdub: how do I mount it then?
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	jdub	Simira: ah, not a webcam ;) it may not have mounted
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	tritium	Simira, not all cameras are usb-storage
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, please, stop
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	zenwhen	anir, I am pretty sure youare trolling.
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	jdub	anir: there is no need to continue this discussion.
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	Simira	jdub: no, my digital one, got a replacement for the stolen one today
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	Simira	tritium: this should be
2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	zenwhen	So just stop, or leave. This isnt #defendlinux.

2005-01-01T08:14:00.000Z	trukulo	anir: try another channel, please, this is for ubuntu support for users
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	Simira	anon26: installed the java packages?

2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	anon26	well there are so many i don't know which ones to go with
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	trukulo	anon26, look for java in wiki
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	jdub	Simira: is gnome-volume-manager running?
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	anir	i loved ubuntu.. and did not want to leave it.. thats why i hope that it gives me more..
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anon26: if you are using hoary, you should be able to make an educated decision on which you like the best
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	trukulo	there's a howto
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	Simira	anon26: searcj for java, and read the description. It's fairly easy
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	Simira	jdub: yes
2005-01-01T08:15:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: what did you leave it for?
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	Tyche	Anyone here install and running Drupal?
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	ACID|net	whats the best way to do a complete system backup in ubuntu??  Is it ghost?
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, me
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	anir	coz i cant run my windows progs here..
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	tritium	anir, did you install wine?
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: want me to help you figure out alternative linux progs?
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	zenwhen	Anir, more people use Linux because Microsoft is a corrupt monopoly that pushes any and all competitors out of the limelight. Dell doesnt sell desktops wiht Linux because Microsoft would raise their price to Dell. It has nothing to do with quality. It has everything to do with the fact that most people have not even heard of Linux. Ubuntu aims to change that. There will alays be adjustment when switching platforms. You just have to
2005-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	zenwhen	get used to the diffrences and read some guides.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, of course you can't, the same you can't run mac or linux programs on windows
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	jdub	zenwhen: dude, seriously, enough.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	zenwhen	I meant more people use Windows.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	trukulo	sorry jdub
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	zenwhen	Oh ok
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: I just installed it from warty. Now, do I need to follow the readme? Or did it do the database and copying stuff?
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, open me a query if you want
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	zenwhen	I was simply trying to enlighten him.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	jdub	zenwhen: after you'd been asked to stop.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, particullary, i prefer to install drupal from tar.gz, not package
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	tritium	anir, I can help you install wine.  It can run many, but not all, windows applications.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	zenwhen	Oh, I hadnt seena nything directed towards me. Sorry.
2005-01-01T08:17:00.000Z	trukulo	it's newer version and more... control?
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	anon26	thanks guys
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	jdub	zenwhen: it was directed to the channel.
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	zenwhen	oh ok
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	|QuaD-	tritium: or we can help him find equivalent OSS linux packages
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	anir	tritium i have installed WINE
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	anir	quad: plz
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	zenwhen	jdub, is the channel support only?
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	tritium	anir, okay, just makeing sure
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: what programs do you need?
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	tritium	making sure
2005-01-01T08:18:00.000Z	anir	i am missing my windows games that i used to play quad
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	jdub	zenwhen: no, but off-topic discussion is unnecessary here.
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: thats the only thing we really can't help you with, unless you like ut2k4 or doom3 :)
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	trukulo	jeff, perhaps you can post a channel for off-topic discussions on topic
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	anir	jdub: i beg an apology
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	trukulo	it's an idea
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	Quenyar	anyone got experience configuring ubuntu as an Internet Gateway for a bunch of Windows machines (DSL)?
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: So actually go out and download the drupal and go at it as if it wasn't installed in warty.
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	zenwhen	Every time anyone trues to talk about anything other than support, they are threatened. I thought discussion of Linux was on topic. I'll just stop talking unless I can help someone I suppose.
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	zenwhen	tries*
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	anir	quad: hmm..
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, yes, that's what i do
2005-01-01T08:19:00.000Z	jdub	trukulo: there is the entire rest of the internet available for non-ubuntu discussion...
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	trukulo	sure jdub, but it would help things like this
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: Okay, thank you. Can I check out your site?
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	trukulo	i said it was only an idea
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, badopi.org
2005-01-01T08:20:00.000Z	anir	trukulo thank you
2005-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	anir	see let us come together to make ubuntu better..
2005-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	anir	better than anyother
2005-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	jdub	anir: so there are programs around that will help you run windows software on linux (generally not games), but these are for special cases. in general, there's no point switching to linux while continuing to use windows software.
2005-01-01T08:21:00.000Z	Quenyar	for example, if you're installing ubuntu and it detects two NICs, does it further probe and find the DSL connection?
2005-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: hehe, cannot read it, but looks good. That is what I was looking for. Thank you.
2005-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, i know it's difficult to understand, but if you wanna help, that's not the way
2005-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	trukulo	you can send suggests to bugzilla ubuntu
2005-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, it's spanish :)
2005-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	DaNewB	warty.iso --> 100% download complete! :)
2005-01-01T08:22:00.000Z	tritium	anir, there are different opinions of what would be better.  I don't play video games, so the ability to play windows games wouldn't make ubuntu better for me...
2005-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	anir	tritium: but for the rest 50% people it will be.. why only think about yourself
2005-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, we can't do more than we do
2005-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	tritium	anir, I'm not.  I'm thinking about those that don't care about games.
2005-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	trukulo	if companys make games for linux, then superb
2005-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	jdub	anir: people work on what's important to them.
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	Tyche	How do I get into MySQL if I have never used the base install from warty? Do I need to change the password for root, since the root password isn't working?
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	Quenyar	tritium, however, sometimes being able to review a document in actual MS-Word is required - Open Office is great, but MSW paginates things differently, for example
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	woodysanay	ok guys, I will see you all tomorrow
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	tritium	Quenyar, ???
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	jdub	Tyche: the root account is disabled, use sudo.
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	woodysanay	bye
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	woodysanay	take care
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	anir	tritium: suppose u work in php and i work with java.. so it will be better if it supports both..isnt it
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	trukulo	Quenyar, paginates on word dependes on printer
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	Tyche	jdub how do I sudo mysql? sudo mysql -u <myusername> -p?
2005-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	Quenyar	tritium - a reason to run wine to run a typical windows app not related to games
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, normally, people who develop in linux don't mind about commercial games
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	tritium	Quenyar, okay...
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: games that you would want to play are usuall closed source, so it is more up to the developers
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	trukulo	they develop what they need/like
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	Tyche	jdub: I get and ERROR 2202: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	Tyche	jdub: That is when I enter in my password.
2005-01-01T08:25:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, do you have mysql-server installed?
2005-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	Quenyar	anyone on who has experience in configuring multiple NICs, iptables, routing, etc?
2005-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: checking...
2005-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	trukulo	jdub, i'll help tyche, stay working
2005-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, open me a query if you want
2005-01-01T08:26:00.000Z	tritium	anir, I'm more of a minimalist.  I'd prefer the intersection, rather than the union, of users' needs.
2005-01-01T08:27:00.000Z	tritium	Then let users customize beyond that.
2005-01-01T08:27:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: No, I don't. Installing mysql-server now. Sorry to have bother you jdub. Didn't know you were working on another thing.
2005-01-01T08:27:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, don't worry, if you need help, i'm here
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: Okay, now I am getting access denied when logging in with my username.
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, ok, what command do you use exactly? post here
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Tyche: did you add the user name to the server?
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	|QuaD-	create a database?
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	|QuaD-	etc?
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	anir	rather than searching for YOUR linux.. if one linux can satisfy both of us.. then only we can say its ubuntu..i am not talking about game only.. that was only an example..if linux continues this devident procedure..i mean different distro for different user.. it can never beat windows.. coz see in a company..some 10000 people uses a computer.. so will you make 10000 linux.. because of the fact that 10000 different individual have different need and they like
2005-01-01T08:28:00.000Z	anir	to work on different polatforms
2005-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: I have done nothing, besides install mysql-server and then try to get in using: sudo mysql -u <myusername> -p
2005-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	trukulo	tyche: in <username> , use root
2005-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: as much as linux distros deviate, many factors stay the same for compatibility reasons
2005-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	trukulo	root is default user for mysqld
2005-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	trukulo	and there's no password
2005-01-01T08:29:00.000Z	trukulo	so don't use -p
2005-01-01T08:30:00.000Z	Tyche	trukulo: Nice work!
2005-01-01T08:30:00.000Z	anir	think about it guys.. coz i am a corporate guy and handle 10000 IT pro.. i am still using windows..
2005-01-01T08:30:00.000Z	trukulo	Tyche, add a password in mysql
2005-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	anir	thats a 0 more its 1000
2005-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	trukulo	sudo mysqladmin -u root password
2005-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	|QuaD-	anir: your point?
2005-01-01T08:31:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, you think ppl here don't know about corporate enviroments?
2005-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	anir	quad: my point is that we have to give extensive training to any freshers that joins in linux..
2005-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	anir	no trukulo my point was not to hurt anyone
2005-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	and these are the people whom you call IT Pros?
2005-01-01T08:32:00.000Z	trukulo	anir, please, stay on topic :)

2005-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	trukulo	perhaps your drivers are bad for ubuntu
2005-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	occy	cool beans.  Got base installed.
2005-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	occy	grabbing updates now

2005-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	trukulo	and the drivers
2005-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	occy	man... this stinks when I can get my Mom's laptop to work with Ubuntu but not mine.
2005-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	occy	heh
2005-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	billytwowilly	anyone have any idea why my loki games don't have sound under ubuntu?
2005-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	occy	billytwowilly: do other things have sound?
2005-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	atlas95	my other problem is ; I have once time "save my session" when I have quit my computer and now whenever I reboot my program save start :s but I don't want :(
2005-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	billytwowilly	occy, yah, all other stuff has sound.
2005-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	billytwowilly	I think it may have to do with esd in gnome?
2005-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, maybe you need to disable the sound server before running the games?
2005-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	occy	billytwowilly: hmmm, perhaps, but have you checked aumix  or a mixer to make sure all levels are up and set right?
2005-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	billytwowilly	tritium, how would I do that?
2005-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	billytwowilly	occy, When I run mplayer I have to pass it -ao esd
2005-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	occy	billytwowilly: yeah, tritium could be right.
2005-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, System->Preferences->Sound
2005-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	occy	noone was answering so I was just guessing :)
2005-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, I'm using Hoary.  I hope your menu is setup the same way...
2005-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	billytwowilly	tritium, there is an "enable sound server at startup" but no "shut down sound server"
2005-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	billytwowilly	tritium, I'm running hoary too;)
2005-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, good deal
2005-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, right, but you can disable it.  You can kill the currently running server manually
2005-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	atlas95	ok trukulo i try this thx :)
2005-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	trukulo	ok
2005-01-01T08:58:00.000Z	billytwowilly	tritium, how would I kill it?
2005-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, ps ax | grep esd
2005-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	that will show you the process
2005-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	then kill #
2005-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	ixane	grrr. grub error 18
2005-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	ixane	max cyl exceeds the max supported by bios
2005-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	Yeahh	wassup
2005-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	ixane	this sounds a bit like the error debian had where it couldn't figure out my 160gb hd
2005-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	ogra	ixane: play a bit with the LBA settings of your BIOS ;)
2005-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	ixane	this is an older computer
2005-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	tritium	billytwowilly, did you get it?
2005-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	trukulo	ixane, that computer support that big hds?
2005-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	ixane	it's worked in other distros :/
2005-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	ixane	debian is the only one that has had a problem with it.
2005-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	ixane	the problem was that it ran into that 137 gb limit.
2005-01-01T09:04:00.000Z	trukulo	ixane, knows nothing about it, i'm poor, my hd is 30gb
2005-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	ixane	trukulo: this was a freebie :)
2005-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	ixane	the old hd was 10gb
2005-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	ixane	but in any case, it's annoying.
2005-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	ogra	ixane: its pretty sure solvable with other LBA settings, but if your BIOS doesnt support it :(
2005-01-01T09:07:00.000Z	ixane	perhaps I can manually enter in the geom in my bios
2005-01-01T09:07:00.000Z	ogra	uhh
2005-01-01T09:07:00.000Z	ixane	and LBA is supported btw
2005-01-01T09:08:00.000Z	ogra	ixane: so try switching it if there are different options
2005-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	ixane	the only options I see are LBA, NORMAL, and LARGE
2005-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	ixane	for verious things
2005-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	ixane	various*
2005-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	ogra	ixane: what was set up ?
2005-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	ixane	LBA
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ixane	Normal didn't work
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ogra	ixane: so try large
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ixane	I'm about to try large
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ogra	heh
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ixane	wait for it...
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ixane	wait for it...
2005-01-01T09:10:00.000Z	ixane	it says 'GRUB loading, please wait...' and my floppy drive light came on, but there it sits...
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	ogra	hmm
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	ixane	and my keyboard won't respond.  Caps and Numlock won't do anything
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	ogra	quite bad
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	trukulo	ixane, try config bios in related USB things
2005-01-01T09:11:00.000Z	trukulo	legacy USB , i think
2005-01-01T09:12:00.000Z	ixane	trukulo, A) it's already on B) it's an IDE drive, so how would USB help?
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	ixane	and a PS/2 keyboard
2005-01-01T09:13:00.000Z	ixane	maybe I have to reinstall
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	ixane	grub was set up with it set to LBA
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	trukulo	ixane, that's about keyboard lock
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	ixane	oh
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	ogra	ixane: shouldnt matter for the mbr
2005-01-01T09:14:00.000Z	ixane	lets see if it'll detect the full HD size with the config set to normal
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	ogra	good idea
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	ixane	in the install I mean
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	occy	gimp 2.2 in hoary?
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	ixane	odd though.  No distro except for debian based ones has had a problem with it
2005-01-01T09:15:00.000Z	ixane	and I've tried a few
2005-01-01T09:17:00.000Z	bborkk	What's the digital camera situation like on Ubuntu these days?  I'm thinking about buying a Canon SD300 camera, but I haven't found any information about whether or not it plays well with Linux in general and Ubuntu in particular.
2005-01-01T09:20:00.000Z	JStrike	bborkk : Look at gphoto.org
2005-01-01T09:23:00.000Z	elmo	sorry
2005-01-01T09:23:00.000Z	ixane	hell. I probobly have to make a boot partition that's before cyl 1024
2005-01-01T09:25:00.000Z	ogra	bborkk: a400 and a75 work..... not sure about SD300, but with a little luck canon uses the same protocol eveywhere
2005-01-01T09:25:00.000Z	occy	w00p, it installed and even X is working
2005-01-01T09:27:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	hows ubuntu for using it as a webserver?
2005-01-01T09:27:00.000Z	Ribs	Captain_Obvious, fine, I'm told
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	Ribs	personally, I would rather use Debian for server duties
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	nakee	Captain_Obvious: try www.freedesktop.org :)
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	ogra	Captain_Obvious: look at www.ubuntulinux.org it seems to cope good with the userbase
2005-01-01T09:28:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs: why that ?
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	djuuss	hey
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	Ribs	because Debian is well suited for the task. Ubuntu is more of a desktop distro.
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	Ribs	I'm not saying there is anything wrong with Ubuntu, it's great for what it is. But I personally would rather use Debian
2005-01-01T09:29:00.000Z	djuuss	what apt mirror do i use for packages found in for instance.. the PLF?
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	mgedmin	AFAIU one reason to prefer Ubuntu to Debian on a server is that Debian woody is 2 years old, and Debian sarge does not have security updates
2005-01-01T09:30:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs: how did you get this idea ? ubuntu is debian under the hood....with a lot improvements debian will see way later....ever tried a custom install of ubuntu ?
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	Ribs	I am aware it's based on Debian, but has a lot of extras that I would never consider on a server. And no, I haven't tried a custom installation.
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	well, atm i have one comp and it'll be both a server and a desktop
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Ribs: supposedly the ubuntu developers use it as a server
2005-01-01T09:31:00.000Z	ixane	that's it. I'm done playing games with the installer.  I'm going to do a custom install
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	ixane	hopefully that'll actually work
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	ogra	Ribs: you get a slim (200mb) base system, nothing else, then you can add your server stuff
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	i should be getting a comp soon for use as a server
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	Ribs	*shrug*, like I said. It's personal preference
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	and im going to be installing the new distro this weekend
2005-01-01T09:32:00.000Z	|QuaD-	Captain_Obvious: the new distro?
2005-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	which will probably be ubuntu
2005-01-01T09:33:00.000Z	|QuaD-	oh
2005-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	kayali	hello there
2005-01-01T09:34:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	hopefully i get the computer soon

2005-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	EpheMeroN	Hey guys. I just did an install of Ubuntu last night. What's the easiest way to upgrade Firefox from 0.9.3 to 1.0?
2005-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	Captain_Obvious	are there any problems installing kde on ubuntu?
2005-01-01T09:35:00.000Z	Ribs	EpheMeroN, With the backports project

2005-01-01T09:38:00.000Z	nakee	especialy since debian kernel on stable is way behind
2005-01-01T09:38:00.000Z	EpheMeroN	there's no simple apt-get install firefox type command?
2005-01-01T09:38:00.000Z	EpheMeroN	i already added the repositories listed on the user guide

2005-01-01T09:39:00.000Z	nakee	EpheMeroN: it depends if you want to keep stable or move to development
2005-01-01T09:40:00.000Z	EpheMeroN	I just want to upgrade to 1.0 and then install Java and Flash.
2005-01-01T09:41:00.000Z	ogra	EpheMeroN: flash is in multiverse .... for java see the wiki

2005-01-01T09:42:00.000Z	AMIGrAve	First time that I ask to ask, but are KDE Ubuntu questions allowed ?
2005-01-01T09:43:00.000Z	nakee	ogra: why is that?there are packages for flash on various platforms
2005-01-01T09:43:00.000Z	ogra	kayali: better question....how stable is hoary tommorow ;)
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	ogra	nakee: i see only flashplayer-mozilla in synaptic.....
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	kayali	ogra: I was gonna ask it just after ;)
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	ogra	*g*
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	djuuss	AMIGrAve: all questions allowed, but since not everyone uses kde, there aren't as many people who know the answers
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	bborkk	JStrike: Thanks.  I'll take a look.
2005-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	ogra	kayali: nobody can say .....
2005-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	ogra	AMIGrAve: since ubuntu ust gets a community based branch called kubuntu....
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Riddell	AMIGrAve: KDE Ubuntu questions are allowed
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	kayali	ogra: kubuntu? do they have a homepage I could check?
2005-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Riddell	kayali: no homepage yet, there's a wiki page
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	ogra	kayali: there was a talk in mataro at the conference... i think you can find somethink on the wiki
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	nakee	what wiki does ubuntu site uses?
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	ACID|net	|-)
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	AMIGrAve	yeah I heard about kubuntu but it is hard to get information about it except the wiki page on ubuntu
2005-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	ACID|net	hmmm, setting up apache is a lot harder than i expected
2005-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	Riddell	AMIGrAve: what information would you like?
2005-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	ACID|net	i want it to be setup like a production server but i dont what it should look like
2005-01-01T09:50:00.000Z	ACID|net	i want multi-ips and multi-domains but all internal so what should i do???
2005-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	ACID|net	<VirtualHost testlocal.localdomain>
2005-01-01T09:51:00.000Z	ACID|net	and then edit the hosts.conf to testlocal.localdomain
2005-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	kayali	how come I can't find 'smbmount' on my fresh warty install? I'm new to ubuntu and find it strange that it seems not to come with samba... since Nautilus fails to see the windows computer, I thought 'mount -t smbfs' would do, but it seems the kernel also comes without smbfs support...
2005-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	occy	anything I gotta do to be able to ssh to my ubuntu box?  I do a which ssh and it is in /usr/bin
2005-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	naibed	hi
2005-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	djuuss	anyone tried the new debian drivers for nvidia instead of the 6111 ubuntu package?
2005-01-01T09:52:00.000Z	AMIGrAve	Riddell: three things : 1) is it a very early project or is there already a preview running  2) is it as free as ubuntu and debian   3) If I want to help the project, what can I do, who should I contact ?
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	ogra	occy: install openssh-server, there is only the client by default
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	occy	ogra: ahh, danke
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	ACID|net	1) warty is a proper release
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	ACID|net	1) been out since ocoter
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	derJunior	hi@all
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	ogra	occy gern geschen
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	occy	ogra: :)
2005-01-01T09:53:00.000Z	ogra	:)
2005-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	ACID|net	opps sorry, misread
2005-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	derJunior	i need some tools: lame galeon and limewire, how can i install this under ubuntu?
2005-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	derJunior	or what do i need to put into the /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2005-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	Riddell	AMIGrAve: it's a very early project, the only things that's been done is some packages have been uploaded to hoary which you can see in hoary-changes
2005-01-01T09:54:00.000Z	derJunior	ogra: ne idee?
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	naibed	derJunior, apt-get them. If they're not in the ubuntu repos, uncomment the "world" repositories (/etc/apt/sources.list)
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	Riddell	AMIGrAve: it is of course Free Software and will be available at no cost once CDs are available
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	ogra	AMIGrAve: ask haggai if he comes around
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	kayali	no one knows how to mount a windows share with ubuntu?
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	derJunior	naibed: hm i have uncomment the world repoitories
2005-01-01T09:55:00.000Z	naibed	Kaloz, mount -t smbfs //IP/C /mnt/C -o WORKGROU=FOO,guest
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	Riddell	AMIGrAve: 3) good question, what is your experience and skills, we don't have a mailing list yet unfortunatly, you can add comments on the wiki page
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	ogra	derJunior: dunno if galeon is in hoary, limewire depends on ava i think...
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	kayali	naibed: unsupported filesystem type...
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	naibed	kayali, try with smbmount (if you don't have it, install it)
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	derJunior	ogra: hm i don't understand you
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	kayali	naibed: but doesnt smbmount come with samba?
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	calc	kayali: go to "Network Servers" click on "File" click on "Connect to Servers"
2005-01-01T09:56:00.000Z	naibed	Kaloz, with smbfs pkg
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	ogra	derJunior: there is no java in ubuntu.... so no limewire as it is a ava program
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	ogra	java
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	naibed	ogra, what?
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	derJunior	ogra: oh okay but that is bad
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	derJunior	i need java to
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	derJunior	too
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	kayali	calc: wow, thanks... that worked ;)
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	ogra	derJunior: for java and lame: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2005-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	ACID|net	anyone got a wiki for apache??
2005-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	derJunior	oh there is a wiki

2005-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	derJunior	great
2005-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	ogra	ACID|net: www.apache.org ;)
2005-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	AMIGrAve	Riddell: well I've not good skills in programming (just python, php, C# (yeah, I know ;-) and I did C long time ago,) as the required skills for KDE are around C++ i'm out of the game for that, but I want to learn deb packaging.
2005-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	ogra	cenerentola: hi ;)
2005-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	naibed	Does anyone know how can I join to rosetta project? I mean how can I register to be able to translate programs via web?
2005-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	Riddell	what's the name of the gnome RSS reader?
2005-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	calc	blam, or thunderbird
2005-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	naibed	Riddell, apt-cache search gnome rss
2005-01-01T10:00:00.000Z	calc	blam doesn't show pictures, etc
2005-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	linux_mafia	i like liferea the best, but crashes every 2 seconds
2005-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	linux_mafia	well it did last time i tried it
2005-01-01T10:01:00.000Z	linux_mafia	calc, blam shows pics
2005-01-01T10:02:00.000Z	ogra	Riddell: liferea is also a good one
2005-01-01T10:04:00.000Z	Riddell	ogra: ah, that's the one I was thinking of, thanks
2005-01-01T10:07:00.000Z	eim	I'm experiencing some troubles with a fresh installed Warty version on a Dell Dimension (8300): The grub boot loader hangs during the boot process: I just get some "GRUB, GRUB, ..." on the upper left corner. Any suggestions? Thanks.
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	eim	grub is installed in the MBR. Maybe I should install it on the first partition.
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	naibed	eim, have a look at grub's bugs (more than ubuntu specific..)
2005-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	eim	naibed: I don't think it's a *real* grub bug but much more a miss-configuration.
2005-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	linux_mafia	for those running hoary, in the newly appeared debian menu, are there duplicates of all the entries?
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	ogra	eim: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia, they put the Debian menu back in Hoary ?
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	eim	ogra: I'll check, thanks.
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	ogra	linux_mafia: it will surely disappear soon
2005-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	ogra	LinuxJones: its a bug i think.....
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ogra, I hope so :D
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones, at the moment its there, i assume it will go soon
2005-01-01T10:12:00.000Z	derJunior	ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ <-- this is the URL
2005-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	derJunior	but how can i put it into the sources.list
2005-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	ogra	derJunior: is broken
2005-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	occy	hmmm, can't seem to get X to go into 1024x768 full screen.  It just makes the window smaller (from 1400x1050) onscreen.
2005-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	derJunior	what i syntax do i need
2005-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	derJunior	ogra: *grmL*

2005-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	ogra	derJunior: marillat seems not to work anymore
2005-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	derJunior	ogra: hmkay and what can i use instead of this?
2005-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones, i never noticed any problems, so cant say if its been fixed or not
2005-01-01T10:14:00.000Z	ftwig	updating WiFi Howtos, anyone there who wnderstands WiFi who can have a look?

2005-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	derJunior	okay this isn't better
2005-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	Pozac	Rewop, you should not
2005-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	ogra	derJunior: for hoary there is a working mplayer in multiverse

2005-01-01T10:19:00.000Z	derJunior	ogra: hm okay
2005-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	Rewop	Pozac: but in the forums everyone talks like if they have switched..
2005-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	ogra	Rewop: hoary is unstable, breaks from time to time.....and is in steady flux
2005-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	Rewop	Pozac: aha
2005-01-01T10:20:00.000Z	Pozac	Rewop, because they can. It's free, though still in development. There are many great things going on in the free software world now, so for many - the newer the better :)
2005-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	Rewop	Pozac: ok
2005-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	ogra	Rewop: its the version that is currently developed and will be the next stable release in april
2005-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	Pozac	yeh
2005-01-01T10:21:00.000Z	Pozac	so when you're done exploring and knowing all about warty, hoary is ready for you :)
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	the--dud	and now for something completely different: ubuntu suffers some major norwegian language confusion
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	derJunior	do i only have to change warty with hoary in my sources.list?
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	the--dud	one second its bokml, next its danish, then its suddenly nynorsk
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	ogra	Rewop: but if you want to help to track bugs and dont care about the instabilities (and know how to fix certain things) hoary is for you
2005-01-01T10:22:00.000Z	Pozac	derJunior, yep
2005-01-01T10:23:00.000Z	kayali	is there somewhere I can see a list of packages for ubuntu? I mean, the content of the repositories... I remember seeing that somewhere on the website
2005-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	thenuke	synaptic
2005-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	Rewop	ogra: i'm quite new to all this ubuntu stuff :) .. but why aren't they like upgrading the packages and stuff? in debian they did it all the time.. and for about 2 months ago they did it with ubuntu too, i think..
2005-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	Pozac	kayali, synaptic?
2005-01-01T10:24:00.000Z	kayali	Pozac: I'm looking for a website

2005-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	Pozac	kayali, I believe there is... somewhere..
2005-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	ogra	Rewop: the stable release of debian only gets security updates, nohing else...as ubuntu stable does
2005-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	Rewop	aha.. so they were uprgading warty when IT was unstable..
2005-01-01T10:25:00.000Z	Rewop	now i get it..

2005-01-01T10:29:00.000Z	Pozac	Rewop, you need to reconfigure your XF86Config
2005-01-01T10:30:00.000Z	ogra	the--dud: hmm, warty wont see any updates execpt critical stuff....

2005-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	Rewop	ogra: i have done that.. but i can only configure one card.. at least what i saw..

2005-01-01T10:31:00.000Z	naibed	kayali, did you miss any gstreamer plugin?
2005-01-01T10:32:00.000Z	Rewop	you'll have to excuse my english.. i'm a foreigner :)

2005-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	djuuss	specially if it should fit with "hoary warthog"
2005-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	ogra	the--dud: also a thing for the ubuntu-devel list ;)
2005-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	djuuss	(e.g. don't record your mom as a sound theme just because she fits the description)
2005-01-01T10:35:00.000Z	Pozac	hoary hedgehog?

2005-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	naibed	Why do I get an " A system error occurred. " error while trying to upload any translation with rosetta? Maybe a server problem or it' my fault?
2005-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	djuuss	prolly your fault
2005-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	djuuss	check your fwall and modem
2005-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	naibed	djuuss, :? don't think it's a firewall problem..
2005-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	djuuss	hmm
2005-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	djuuss	why not
2005-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	djuuss	?
2005-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	naibed	djuuss, because 1)I don't have any firewall (nor NAT) and 2) a problem with my fw/modem trying to send a POST ..?
2005-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	Rewop	when i setup my Shortcut Keys to pause music when i press ctrl-shift-s, i can't use the "s"-key after that, why is that?
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	djuuss	can you send POST without rosetta?
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	naibed	djuuss, of course
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	ogra	naibed: are you logged in ?
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	djuuss	and you got rosetta through apt?
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	naibed	ogra, yes
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	Pozac	Rewop, sounds like a bug. Does it happen with other shortcut keys?
2005-01-01T10:41:00.000Z	ogra	djuuss: rosetta is a server
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	naibed	djuuss, I mean the web..
2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	Pozac	apt-get install google.com

2005-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	Rewop	Pozac: only with letters and numbers i think..
2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	justin2	how can I disable IPv6?
2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	ogra	Rewop: laptop ?

2005-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	djuuss	np
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	crimsun	justin2: why do you want to disable IPv6? :)
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	ogra	djuuss: for rosetta: https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	justin2	I get slow dns quaries
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	Rewop	anyone else experienced the same? could someone just test if it works on their machines?
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	naibed	So anyone can confirm me that it's not my fault? :?
2005-01-01T10:44:00.000Z	crimsun	justin2: blame your ISP
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	Building Dependency Tree... Done

2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	does that mean that there is no update available?
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	naibed	D0wnXcaST, that's it
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	crimsun	justin2: you can also use iptables to discard IPv6 packets
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	ogra	D0wnXcaST: looks like;)
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	because i juste re-install ubuntu, shouldn't have new update?
2005-01-01T10:45:00.000Z	ogra	justin2: everywhere or only in certain apps ?
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	naibed	D0wnXcaST, you can dist-upgrade to hoary..
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	plattypus1	Hi all.
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	crimsun	'lo plattypus1
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	plattypus1	I need help. I'm trying to get Ubuntu and a self-compiled kernel to get along.
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: why that ?
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	plattypus1	However, every time I try to boot it kernel panics, no root found.
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: did you create the initrd image?
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	naibed: what is this &
2005-01-01T10:46:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	hoary?
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	ogra	D0wnXcaST: its the unstable development branch
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	Snegec	Anyone can tell me what these 3 things mean? Assertion (heads < 256) at disk_dos.c:486 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	Snegec	Assertion ((C * heads + H) * sectors + S == A) at disk_dos:495 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: then rebuild your kernel with support for the root filesystem in it.
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	Pozac	plattypus1, what do you need a self compiled kernel for?
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	Snegec	Assertion (heads > 0) at disk_dos.c:485 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	ogra	D0wnXcaST: dont upgrade to it if you canz handle instability and breakage
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	ogra	cant
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	ok, than i wont upgrade to it
2005-01-01T10:47:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: not as a module ("m") but directly as "y"
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	I'm new to linux, only 2 weeks now
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	:)
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	naibed	Snegec, an assertion is something that shouldn't happen :)
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	Pozac	I assert that naibed is wrong
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	naibed	:o
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	plattypus1	Pozac, first, I think it helps performance, and second I want to make Linuxant's DriverLoader work and it doesn't like the kernel-source package.
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	Pozac	;)
2005-01-01T10:48:00.000Z	ogra	D0wnXcaST: did you already enable universe and multiverse to get more software ?
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	Snegec	naibed: I reckon it's my hard drive.. but no test or anything detects it.. Windows Scandisk wont get past FAT and I get blue screens in windows at times something about VFAT(01).. but I can't install Linux cuz of this :()
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	Pozac	plattypus1, ok.. it's probably the filesystem thing crimsun said
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: on ubuntu you dont use the kernel-source package
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: linux-source
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	ogra: yes before i re-installed linux, i had installed universe to have WINE.
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	NewComer	guys I need help, left apt to update to hoary overnight, got errors configuring some packages, namely base-config , console-data and console-common.. yet checking most of the packages on finds that they weren't updated, although there's new versions of these packages in /var/cache/apt/archives and running apt-get upgrade again doesn't update them
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	Pozac	plattypus1, I was... mere months ago
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	ill go an enable it
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	naibed	Snegec, make a backup and run fdisk to repair that..
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	:)
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	plattypus1	crimsun, that might be the problem...
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: the problem is more than likely related to the root filesystem's support being in the initrd, which you aren't using.
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: and for linuxant you only need the linux-headers package
2005-01-01T10:49:00.000Z	Snegec	naibed: run fdsik? Like? re-partition the drive?
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	plattypus1	ogra, every time it gives me errors that it can't find autoconf.h and version.h
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	naibed	Snegec, seems like a partition problem, isn't it?
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: you dont even have to reboot
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	Snegec	naibed: I dont know
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	Snegec	Naibed, seems like FAT problem if I was guessing
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	is hoary okay for day-to-day use?
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: got the build-essential package ?
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	or is everything pretty broken?
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	Snegec	and FAT problem on primary drive..
2005-01-01T10:50:00.000Z	plattypus1	build-essential?
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: autoconf, automake, gcc etc
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	naibed	in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	zenwhen	build-essential is all the gcc stuff
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	plattypus1	Yeah, I have those, though I apt-got them individually.
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	Pozac	apt-sorry
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	ferris	i have a package manager question
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: looks like autoconf is missing according your error
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	Pozac	ferris, yeh?
2005-01-01T10:51:00.000Z	martin_	guys what package i need in order to run *.avi files?
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: version.h is only in the linux-headers-foo packages
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	ferris	i installed some programs the were all games... but I cannot find them
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	ferris	they are not under games folder

2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	ferris: how did you install the games?
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	ogra	ferris: look in /usr/games for the executables
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	plattypus1	It says that autoconf.h in /usr/src/linux/somethingorother is missing, then tries to use "/boot/config-2.6.8-1-3-386 on a temporary kernel tree"
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	ferris	through the synaptic package manager
2005-01-01T10:52:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: read what I typed above :)

2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	ferris	checked the progs and chose apply
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	Snegec	naibis: sigh.. oh well.. guess I'll have to reinstall all over again.. jeezus
2005-01-01T10:53:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: there are plenty wiki pages how to install linuxant/slmodem drivers....look there, you only need the headers and build essential
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	naibed	Snegec, make a backup, then have a look with fdisk..
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	Crane	hello
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, go read here https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	plattypus1	I have support for the root fs in my kernel.
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	Quick one for someone :) - Ive installed Ubuntu and its all succesful, its on a dell inspiron 7500 - It goes through the verbose startup no problem, and once its all done that, the screen goes black, if I turn off the laptop, I see the login screen however the computer is shutting down. Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, I use totem-xine :)
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	plattypus1	It's ext3, and both ext2 and 3 are y.
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	naibed	bye
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	martin_	ok ill use it too then :) thanks pozac.
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: and your motherboard chipset and HD drivers?
2005-01-01T10:54:00.000Z	Pozac	You're welcome, martin_ :)
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	ferris	how can I make a link (on the desktop) to /usr/games?
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	crimsun	plattypus1: did you also disable initrd support?
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	ferris	the gui will not allow me to make link
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	plattypus1	I'm not a linux newbie, just not good with this distro. :)
2005-01-01T10:55:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: the point with this distro is....you dont compile anything....
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	Pozac	ferris, middle click and drag
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	ogra	plattypus1: ....you just use it
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	Pozac	plattypus1, ubuntu needs portage!
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	crimsun	did you start with stock kernel source from kernel.org, or are you using kernel-source-foo, or are you using linux-source-foo, or...?
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	Crane	ferris rightclick on desktop and select cfreate launcher
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	ferris	does it seem like there are more and more people switching from MS to linux?
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	crimsun	ubuntu needs portage like a fish needs a bicycle
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	plattypus1	Pozac, That's what gentoo's for. I just don't want a source-based distro on a PII 233. :)
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac ????????
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	Pozac	crimsun, yeah well the fish already has the full body water suit
2005-01-01T10:56:00.000Z	martin_	ferris, whats ms? windows you mean?
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Crane	then in command enter nautilus /usr/games
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra?
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Pozac	hehe
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Pozac	ok ok.. ubuntu, for me, perhaps could might maybe use a little subset of some of portage
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	Pozac	and maybe just one ebuild
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	ferris	yes
2005-01-01T10:57:00.000Z	crimsun	ugh.
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: sudo apt-get build-dep <package> && apt-get source -b <package> is waaay better
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	crimsun	portage is great, but keep it in Gentoo.
2005-01-01T10:58:00.000Z	plattypus1	So where did you say the Linuxant wiki were?
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I'm not convinced. :)
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	ogra	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto at the bottom for example
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	the--dud	dont suppose there are any US based ubuntu rsync servers?
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	plattypus1	ogra, thankies.
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: tried ?
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, can i get totem-xine from apt-get?
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	the--dud	more specifically, for the cd images
2005-01-01T10:59:00.000Z	crimsun	the--dud: umn.edu?
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	DaNewB	Just freshly installed Warty. My serial mouse doesnt work. How can I fix this?
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, yes.. follow these instructions https://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-20.3414506543/
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	ferris	thanks for the help on that
2005-01-01T11:00:00.000Z	Pozac	I believe totem-xine is in multiverse anyways
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Agrajag	Pozac: universe
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, no.. don't care so much about that part, I care about it takes 3 minutes to make a new ebuild
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	the--dud	crimsun, its not listed to have rsync on the wiki... but it might have anyway...
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: depends on what you compile i guess
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	Pozac	Agrajag, ok..
2005-01-01T11:01:00.000Z	mh_le	How "new" are the packages in ubuntu? same as debian?
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	'totem-xine' is in universe
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, apt has never been my friend, synaptic is my friend :)
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	(as Agrajag said)
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: synaptic cant build packages (yet)
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, i have totem-gstreamer and it seems to run the movie but i only get the sound without a picture... does that mean i just need divx codec? or should i dl xine?
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Agrajag	get xine
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	martin_	hi Agrajag
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Agrajag	apt-get install totem-xine
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	martin_	ok :)
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	ogra	martin_: get totem-xine
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Agrajag	assuming apt works for you now
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, get totem-xine. the xine backend is better
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	ogra	martin_: from universe
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: do you have 'w32codecs' installed?
2005-01-01T11:02:00.000Z	martin_	yeah Agrajag, works :)
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	martin_	ogra, thanks, ive set it up already
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, so I guess I'm not building packages then
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	martin_	crimsun, i dont know what that is
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	martin_	crimsun, should i get it from apt-get?
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: normally there is no need for building them....
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: dpkg -l w32codecs|grep ^ii
2005-01-01T11:03:00.000Z	Meleis	Hi !
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I know. I don't necessarily want to build the whole system :)
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	martin_	crimsun, man... could you please explain to me what dpkg does and means?
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	Meleis	Does someone know the command line to create Ubuntu ISO CD when having just files and directory ?
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: the idea that anything gets faster with self compiled binarys is a myth i think.....and what you gain through optimization is marginal regarding the work it needs
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	So here it is :) Ive installed Ubuntu and its all succesful, its on a dell inspiron 7500 - It goes through the verbose startup no problem, and once its all done that, the screen goes black, if I turn off the laptop, I see the login screen however the computer is shutting down. Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
2005-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I just like that if I can see on the lists that a new gnome-panel has been released, I can copy gnome-panel-1.1 to gnome-panel-1.2 and install it (presuming nothing radically has changed)
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	nash	hello guys
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	martin_	no packages found matching w32codecs|grep ^ii, crimsun
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	the--dud	at least i cant connect to umn.edu through rsync ;/
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Meleis: are you sure you don't want to just download an iso?
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	martin_	oh dpkg means download package?
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	Agrajag	on, dpkg handles Debian packages
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: 'w32codecs' is in Christian Marillat's repo. See the wiki under Restricted formats
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I also find it a myth. Ubuntu works as fast or faster than gentoo :)
2005-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	martin_	oh, d stands for debian?
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	Agrajag	yes
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	ogra	yep
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	tolstoy_	folks, updated to hoary, no xorg.conf.  X -configure didn't work (or do I need to be out of X).  What was that deb-something command I need to get an xorg conf to appear?
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	Meleis	crimsun, i did but the md5sum failed... so i mounted it and i did "md5sum -c md5sum.txt" he told me which files had problems, so i downloaded them again... they are ok. Now i would like to build the CD...
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	martin_	ok crimsun.. what is wiki btw?
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	nash	guys, at boot the "starting hotplug subsystem" step takes 40 sec! any tip to speed up my boot?
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	djuuss	tolstoy_: you need to be out of X :)
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	ogra	tolstoy_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-01-01T11:06:00.000Z	crimsun	martin_: it's explained on the wiki :)
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	ogra	djuuss: nope
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	djuuss	you dont?
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	kquamme94	hows everyone doing?/
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	occy	hey... I've done apt-get install nvidia-settings linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1-3-686     What do I need to do to setup nvida on this laptop?   ( nVidia GeForce2 Go chipset )
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	martin_	ftp.nerrim.net/debian-marrilat, crimsun?
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	djuuss	occy: $ nvidia-glx-config enable
2005-01-01T11:07:00.000Z	ogra	djuuss: nope, but i think you dont reconfigure it if it already rund....the changes take effect on next X startup then
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	martin_	i got that repository, xskoulax helped me out with that one, crimsun
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	ogra	runs
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Agrajag	martin_: have you run apt-get update since adding it?
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	martin_	ill go run a search in synapt..
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	ogra	occy: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	nash	guys, at boot the "starting hotplug subsystem" step takes 40 sec! any tip to speed up my boot?
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	martin_	Agrajag, yi dont think i have, ill run it now
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Pozac	(ogra: notice how many people here are having apt-related problems)
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	Meleis: use mkisofs(8) to generate an .iso
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	siretart	perhaps you guys want to have a look at https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/InstallingMplayerFromHoaryInWarty
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	Agrajag	martin_: k, after that you should be able to get w32codecs
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	Meleis: read the man page, or look for a how-to
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	zenwhen	nash, hoary's hotplug is much faster.
2005-01-01T11:08:00.000Z	djuuss	ogra: well if i were reconfiguring X i'd want to see what it changed, so beeing out of X isn't a bad idea, though not imperative perhaps
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	gilligan_	hi
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: this will get better in hoary
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	tolstoy_	ogra, seems like someone here did something different to get it working, but I'll try that.
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	occy	ogra: k, tx, err... danke
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	occy	heh
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	ogra	djuuss: ctrl-alt-backspace works here too ;)
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	djuuss	nash: i'tll wear out
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	Meleis	crimsun, ok i was just hoping a dev to be here and the things going easier... thanks anyway
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	zenwhen	You can get hoary's hotplug system for warty in the ubuntu backports.
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	crimsun	Meleis: devs are in here
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	martin_	Agrajag, ok its all updated, ill try to get w32codecs
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	djuuss	ogra: gotta love that combo :)
2005-01-01T11:09:00.000Z	nash	zenwhen: point me to some links
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	crimsun	Meleis: fortunately your question can be answered with a quick Google search
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	gilligan_	i just did an apt-get upgrade ( running hoary) and my sound ceased to work.. none of the apps complain or report any errors but i dont *hear* any output ;--]  has anythnig changed recently in that regard ? any hints ? ..
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	tolstoy_	weird.  updating to hoary didn't install the xorg server.  very weird.
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	Meleis	crimsun : with xcdroad i can make some ISOs, but there are some files he resized cause of Joliet limitations
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	djuuss	has it been released???
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	djuuss	just now?
2005-01-01T11:10:00.000Z	zenwhen	Nash: we better discuss this in #ubuntuforums ... the people in here dont like backport discussions.
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	martin_	ok, downloading :)
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Pozac	gilligan_, are you running KDE?
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	occy	ogra: <-- rox
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Meleis	crimsun, xcdroad > xcdroast
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, they want their mplayers that work and new firefoxes?
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: bah
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Pozac	hehe
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	gilligan_	Pozac: i have some kde packages installed but dont actually use it
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	nash	ok zenwhen, thanks...
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	zenwhen	ogra, some people want improvements and dont have time to test a new distro.
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Meleis	ok, anyway, does anybody knows how to mount read-write (not read only) an ISO ?
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	gilligan_	Pozac: why - does that break anything?
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac:  i could live with the old ff.....i would still use it
2005-01-01T11:11:00.000Z	Pozac	gilligan_, Ok.. kmix sometimes sets the audio output to the SP/DIF channel
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	zenwhen	http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntu-bp/ thats the backports project
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	gilligan_	oh.. i found some error on startup..
2005-01-01T11:12:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, Lets see what happens in a couple of releases :)
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, afterall, warty is a warthog
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: i know, i use the ff backport too, but there is really no need....and building a complete set of ff packages takes a lot of time....which i would rather see for improvements....
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	gilligan_	starting alsa.. /etc/rc2.d/S12alsa: Error: alsactl restore failed with message: alsactl: set_control:805: warning: name mismatch (DRC Switch/DRC Range ) for control #8

2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	djuuss	i'm getting myself a dual boot of yoper, their site is back online so i'll try it out
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	gilligan_	any alsa experts around? ;-}
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	Meleis	ok... :o(
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: so hoary will miss things again, because the manpower was missing ....
2005-01-01T11:13:00.000Z	zenwhen	ogra, well If things like FF 1.0 arent going to be offered fro warty, someone needs to offer it.

2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	zenwhen	for*
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, has the manpower been missing?
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: why, 0.9.3 worked fine
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Pozac	people want the newest version
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: every helping hand improves
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	zenwhen	ogra, thats not the point for most people. They want the newest version.
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Pozac	desktop people want the newest version
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	zenwhen	And ntohing will stop them from wanting it.
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	ogra	what for ?
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Pozac	pride
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	ogra	bah
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	Pozac	freedom
2005-01-01T11:14:00.000Z	ogra	ok
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	zenwhen	Its better that people run warty and still file bug reports on other packahges in it than switch to another diestro to get what they want.
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	zenwhen	distro*
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	djuuss	talking about latest version.. when will OOo 1.1.3 make it into warty?
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	Pozac	never
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	No.
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	Amaranth	Warty is frozen, it won't change.
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	Pozac	unless you backport it
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: dont you think a 6 month release cycle is enough ? i can live 6 months with the current version
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	occy	ogra: much better looking
2005-01-01T11:15:00.000Z	djuuss	arg
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	crimsun	hey occy, how's the triath training going?
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	occy	crimsun: did my first 21 miler sunday!
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	djuuss	guess i'll back up my /home and try hoary
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	occy	w00p
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	crimsun	nice!
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	ogra	wpw
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	occy	whew, it was work, that's for sure.
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	djuuss	ciao
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	occy	sites are down due to upgrade of the php bug.
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	zenwhen	ogra, many people can't. I dont see how backports hurt anyone. There are people who want a) updated software and b) stability. Backports + warty is just that.
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	naibed	gilligan_, try witch alsactl..
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	occy	otherwise I'd point you to em'
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	occy	:)
2005-01-01T11:16:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	So here it is :) Ive installed Ubuntu and its all succesful, its on a dell inspiron 7500 - It goes through the verbose startup no problem, and once its all done that, the screen goes black, if I turn off the laptop, I see the login screen however the computer is shutting down. Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Pozac	portage is excellent for this task
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	saif	hello, guys, any good books on how to develop web applications using mono?!?! if that is possible?!?!
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: whoa, slow down
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	DaNewB	How can I make my serial mouse work?
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	crimsun	saif: yes, there's an excellent one. Hold.
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: i didnt say they hurt anyone.....i am just a little sad that the manpower gets lost on a dead dog
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Pozac	if you want newer than warty and not unstable - compile it yourself, using portage
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	crimsun: Mono: A Developer's Handbook? :)
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	naibed	or pkgsrc :P
2005-01-01T11:17:00.000Z	occy	hmmm
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, X error probably
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	saif	was that too fast?!?! sorry! :)
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	occy	at 1024x768 there is some wierd blurring of things
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	etorix	yeah .. if you have a week to spare
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, can you use CTRL-ALT-F1 to jump to a console when the screen is black?
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	NewComer	darksatanic, edit ur XF86config, put /dev/tty0
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	let me just check that one
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	occy	it's crystal clear at 1400x1050
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	occy	(which I'd love to use by my almost 60 year old Mom would have issues with that res)
2005-01-01T11:18:00.000Z	bytecoder	occy: why would you want to run X at a lower resolution then the max?
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	NewComer	DaNewB, edit ur XF86config, put /dev/tty0 as input device in mouse section
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	ogra: If you want up-to-the-minute packages use hoary or gentoo. The 6-month cycle is designed for have a system that doesn't change little by little so it's easier to maintain and support.
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	saif	Amaranth: thanx!! i'll chk it out!
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	occy	bytecoder: see above :)
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	zenwhen	ogra, well it is a double edged sword. People would compile the apps themseleves if they wanted them. this just makes it easier. I refuse to run hoary until there is a preview ISO.
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	NewComer	darksatanic, sorry that wasn't for u
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	ogra	Amaranth: heh, i know :)
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, when i mark xine for installation it tells me that i need to remove gstreamer and desktop(?) and to install xine
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I find it weird that people who give their software away in two versions - stable and unstable - cannot give their users stable updates for 6 months
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	martin_	to install xine*
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, Yes. Do it.
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	zenwhen	No matter how helpful it might be, I cannot be incovenienced with instability.
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Amaranth: of course :)
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: i got an extra box for hoary testing and development :)
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	Prozac: ctrl-alt-f1 took me to the console yeah
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	Amaranth	zenwhen: You can't make a preview ISO of a constantly moving target. It literally changes every hour.
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	martin_	Pozac, ok.
2005-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	crimsun	saif: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/monoadn/
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	ogra	zenwhen: but use warty for all my work
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, ubuntu-desktop is just a empty package to make sure you install all the stuff the ubuntu guys want you to have is there
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	crimsun	saif: in fact, look here: http://www.mono-project.com/about/books.html
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	DaNewB	NewComer, thnks, i'll try
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	crimsun: I talk to the author from time to time on irc.gnome.org :)
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Amaranth:)
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, and totem-xine conflicts with totem-gstreamer, which is needed by ubuntu-desktop :)
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	zenwhen	ogra, I have a warty server and a warty desktop. I am thinking baout building a third box for Hoary testing.
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	saif	all righty! thanx a lot!
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	ogra	martin_: reinistall this package before you upgrade to the next stable version of ubuntu....many things will rely on it
2005-01-01T11:20:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: You probably want an ASP.NET book and the Mono one.
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	bytecoder	you could always install gstreamer-mad, which enables support for the "controversial" formats
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, login and edit your XF86Config
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: The ASP.NET one will teach you how to use that and the Mono one will show you how to setup mono to use it for web sites.
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	awesome, thanks prozac!
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	bytecoder	I think you need to enable the debian marillat repository to get it, though
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	saif	Amaranth: I don't think i need the asp.net one,
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, do you know what to do to fix it?
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	saif	Amaranth: been developing c# for 2 years now!
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, I think your resolution might be too high by default or something
2005-01-01T11:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	oh
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	Not really :) But I figured google could help me out instead of bothering you guys some more :)
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: Then just get Mono: A Developer
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	err, that one :P
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	saif	Amaranth: thanx for the advice though, will get the mono one!
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	eim	grub-install has just destroied the boot-sector of an NTFS partition. Any ideas on how to recover it? Thanks.
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, I'll help you out
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	okay, sweet deal then :)
2005-01-01T11:22:00.000Z	martin_	cool Pozac, it works :)
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: If you want to talk to the author I believe he is edd on irc.gnome.org. He would be in #mono.
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	martin_	why does it take so much time to load though?
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	ogra	martin_: dont forget ygout the package on upgrade ;)
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	ogra	about
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	saif	really?!?!
2005-01-01T11:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	eim: Don't, use grub to boot windows.
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: Yeah.
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, just open the file in your editor (nano -w /etc/X11/XF86Config), find the section with the resolutions and remove the highest one on all lines
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	saif	nice nice! good to know that, i don't think i wanna bother him with stuff that i can read in books! if i run into walls or problems i'kk go there! :)
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Pozac	unless it's the resolution you intend to use and know the monitor can do, ofcourse :)
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: Just ask him if his book has what you need. :)
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, np :)
2005-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, Does it take a long time to load?
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Pozac	More than a couple of seconds?
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: please dont forget to tell the people that ubuntu-desktop is very important on a stable to stable upgrade
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	saif	Amaranth: thanx a milion! i'll go there then! c ya!
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	saif: See you there. :)
2005-01-01T11:25:00.000Z	saif	exit
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	saif	:)
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: there will be important things missing if they upgrade and the package is not there
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	Pozac	martin_, the ubuntu-desktop package is very important when you upgrade to hoary in april
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	AndyR	lo ppl
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: thanks ;)
2005-01-01T11:26:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, ok..
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, now, not to nag, but can't both totem's just provide a totem like portage?
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Amaranth, is that edd dumbill, you talking about?
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, so it won't be removed when totem-xine is installed?
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	linux_mafia: Yeah.
2005-01-01T11:27:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, that is, you must admit, kinda lame...
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Amaranth, sweet, he seems like a pretty damn smart guy from what ive read
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: nope, its a policy you have to make if you want to give professional support
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	guru	hi m8s
2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	guru	does anybody know sth. about the root user?

2005-01-01T11:28:00.000Z	guru	I am new to ubuntu
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	guru	So I did not find the root user
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	scizzo	guru: did you read the thing before you created the account?
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	gilligan_	hm.noone else experiencing troubles with sound in hoary ?

2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	stvn	guru: sudo is your friend
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	scizzo	guru: ubuntu is using sudo
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	pozac: Did I need to be root to edit XF86Config?
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	naibed	https://launchpad.ubuntu.com refuses connection :S
2005-01-01T11:29:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: thats fine....but canonical probably once wants to live from its supported part ;)
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	guru	not really all the other distributions I tried had ther sth like normal user
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, yes.. sudo nano sorry :(
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	ahh np :)
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	crimsun	gilligan_: nope. Sound's fine here.
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	ogra	guru: please read the wiki
2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	ogra	naibed: so probably someone is working on it.....
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I'm not sure what my helping out supporting what I use and know about has anything to with how canonical wants to live?
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	naibed	ogra, shit! XD
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	guru	ok thx m8s

2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	stvn	Pozac: shh, there are a lot of canonical ppl here, they want to get paid ;)
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: canonical made ubuntu possible..... who do you think pays for this all ?
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, However, any advice and comments on my behaviour is gladly appreciated, don't get me wrong
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	naibed	Bad Gateway: the proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	crimsun	gilligan_: well, what player are you using?
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	DaNewB	NewComer, after editing XF86Config, what do I do?
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, I know I know

2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, Does this mean I cannot help you support these poor noobs?
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Pozac: we're all "noobs"
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	scizzo	Pozac: please...stop using the work "noobs"
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	crimsun	gilligan_: what sound hardware?

2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: so let them make the policy they need for pro support and enjoy the benefit you get from the freeness of their distro ;)
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	ironwolf	what happened to apt in hoary?  I keep getting "unknown error executing gpgv" when I do an apt-get update  Anyone have an idea how to rectify this?

2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	AMIGrAve	what's the difference between package nfs-kernel-server and nfs-user-server ?
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	bassinboy	Chibifs
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: universe is not supported by canonical....and will never be i guess, so they need you for this....
2005-01-01T11:33:00.000Z	Pozac	yes
2005-01-01T11:34:00.000Z	Pozac	And certainly, I will make sure the .. people.. know the true implications of their actions
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	Pozac	And remind them how they must use their package manager to break their video players before they upgrade. :)
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	ogra	heh
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	occy	crimsun: thanks for asking :)
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	Pozac	sadly
2005-01-01T11:35:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: you must not......but it will cause much more support not telling them.....
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	crimsun	occy: np, I remember my own marathon training. :)
2005-01-01T11:36:00.000Z	occy	crimsun: yeah?
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	occy	crimsun: how come you don't hang out in #fitgeek?
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: ubuntu/canonical/gnome simply decided to support gstreamer (which is totem) and only one videoplayer will be in the supported stuff
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	occy	:)
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	occy: didn't know of it til just now :)
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	occy	hehe
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	occy	check out fitgeek.org too
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, Yeh, but ubuntu-desktop is not only supported, it's also required
2005-01-01T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	cool, thanks :)
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, don't you think the package manager should take care of that?
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: only on upgrade
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	Pozac	yeh
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	Pozac	only when needed
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	Pozac	like I don't need ubuntu when my computer is off
2005-01-01T11:38:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: but you would read upgrade notes bfore you upgrade ?
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, Maybe
2005-01-01T11:39:00.000Z	ogra	they will mention this ....
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	Pozac	well
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	Pozac	how does it create more support then?
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	the--dud	rosetta keeps giving me errors when i try to change add some translations >_<
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	Pozac	:)
2005-01-01T11:40:00.000Z	ogra	the ppl that dont read upgrade notes ;)
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	BuckyG	Anyone got ideas on how to get an Zip250 Atapi seen in Warty?
2005-01-01T11:41:00.000Z	calc	load ide-floppy
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	BuckyG	I'm a Wintel newbie.  How do you load ide-floppy?
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	gpled	are their any apps for ubuntu, that would let someone read their hotmail accounts?  want to use t-bird, but hotmail uses http-mail, instead of pop3.
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	Pozac	BuckyG, add it to /etc/modules
2005-01-01T11:42:00.000Z	the--dud	" A system error occurred." so damn informative as well
2005-01-01T11:43:00.000Z	Pozac	BuckyG, or 'modprobe ide-floppy' if you need it now
2005-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	ogra	the--dud: they just reboot it.....
2005-01-01T11:44:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	Pozac: well ive changed the resolutions all the way down to 800x600 which I know this monitor will support, could it be because of thsi error - PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 4 of device 000 0:00:07.1 ?
2005-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, Gee, I'm not sure - could be, though..
2005-01-01T11:47:00.000Z	Pozac	Bumjubeo, Here's a suggestion.. boot the livecd, copy the XF86Config to your disc
2005-01-01T11:47:00.000Z	Bumjubeo	k, makes sense.
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	the--dud	ogra, okay, lets hope it starts working soon then...
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	mh_le	How "new" are the packages in ubuntu? same as debian?
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	xskoulax	newer
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	xskoulax	i think
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	Pozac	eh
2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	Pozac	hoary tracks sid?

2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: yep unilt the codefreeze
2005-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: then the testing starts.....
2005-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	mh_le	xskoulax: how does it deal with self compiled programs?
2005-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: then it gets released
2005-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, that's going to be sweet.
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	BuckyG	Thanks, Pozac.  It's working now...
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	ogra	Pozac: a stable debian every 6 months *g*
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	Pozac	mh_le, or do you mean stable?
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	Pozac	BuckyG, np
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	mh_le	Pozac: yeah, I guess
2005-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	anyone could tell me exactly what a shell account?
2005-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	sorry ig this is newbi, I AM :)
2005-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	ogra	mh_le: the stable packages are from august i think
2005-01-01T11:51:00.000Z	ogra	mh_le: the majority.....some came in later
2005-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	mh_le	I see
2005-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	ogra	mh_le: but the newest are from october
2005-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	mh_le	cool
2005-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	ogra	mh_le: (not regarding the sceurity updates though)
2005-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	Pozac	D0wnXcaST, a shell is the command line interface to the computer. An account is like what the banks use, so they can charge money for it.
2005-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	and all the importannt updates you can get from warty-backports anyway
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	Pozac	D0wnXcaST, an account usually means you get a username
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	whats the link between account and shell?
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	ogra	punkrockguy318: i doubt the importance
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	andy	hi, i'm having issues installing software onto the system.  I'm new at linux, so basic descriptions would be great.  Thanks! :)
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	when i go in my console on ubuntu, is it a shell?
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	ogra	andy http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/SynapticHowto
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	ogra, they're pretty nifty update... xchat, firefox, gaim...
2005-01-01T11:53:00.000Z	ogra	D0wnXcaST: yep
2005-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	ok
2005-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	ogra	punkrockguy318: you said important first ;)
2005-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	Pozac	D0wnXcaST, and you are using your own user-account.
2005-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	ogra	punkrockguy318: they are probably nice or beautiful......but i doubt the importance
2005-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	xskoulax	mh_le, binary i think
2005-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	D0wnXcaST	ok !
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	mh_le	xskoulax: no source?
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	xskoulax	you can get source
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	xskoulax	and compile that if you wish
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	mh_le	goodie
2005-01-01T11:55:00.000Z	etorix	hmm .. no rcconf .. no ksysv ..
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	ogra	etorix: rather gsysv if it yould exist *g*
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	ogra	would
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	etorix	what services-controller is
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	ogra	etorix: rm
2005-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	etorix	on here?
2005-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	ogra	etorix: remove the symlinks in /etc/rc2.d
2005-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	ogra	etorix: or do sudo /etc/init.d/servicename start/stop/reload
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	ogra	etorix: the gnome-system-tools part for runlevel control was buggy when warty got released... for hoary there will be a new tool
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	Pozac	ogra, will the init system change?
